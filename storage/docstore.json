SelectionRevisit and ReflectLearning ObjectivesAt a very large and very noisy party, you\u2019re looking for a friend you\u2019ve lost in the crowd. Youlook for her green dress amid the sea of colors. You try to catch the sound of her voice in the gen-eral roar. There she is! Somehow, above the loud music and noisy conversation, now you hear hercalling your name. But before you can move very far, you are stopped in your tracks by the soundof shattering glass\u2014you turn your head sharply and see that a pitcher has fallen off a nearby table.While others tend to the glass, you set off across the crowded room toward your friend.The processes by which you were able to spot your friend, hear your name despite thenoise of the party, and then quickly turn toward and then away from the sound of the break-ing glass involved attention. In the context of human information processing, attentionis theprocess that, at a given moment, enhances some information and inhibits other information.The enhancement enables us to select some information for further processing, and the in-hibition enables us to set some information aside.Throughout life\u2014indeed, throughout the day and throughout the minute\u2014we are bom-barded by an overwhelming amount of perceptual information; the party is simply a highlydramatic example of what\u2019s going on all the time. Our information-processing capacity cannotmake sense of the constant input from many sources all at once. How do we cope?

How dowe, moment to moment, choose the information that is meaningful and avoid distraction byirrelevant material? One solution is to focus on some particular piece of information (such asthe sound of your own name or a color of interest) and to selectit for processing in preferenceto other bits of available information because of its immediate importance in a given situation.Is attention, then, something that we summon up by will that enables concentration on somepiece of the incoming stimuli? The answer, briefly, is yes; but this is not the whole story. Evenif our intentions and goals are clear and we know exactly what information we are interestedin, other aspects of the input, if sufficiently salient, can capture our attention and distract us,as the sudden noise of breaking glass interrupted your search for your friend.A host of questions immediately arises: while we are attending to one thing, do we ac-tively inhibit and suppress distractions, or do we simply ignore them and let them hover in thebackground? What happens to the information to which we do not attend? What brain sys-tems and mechanisms underlie these attentional abilities, and what disorders arise whenthese systems and mechanisms are damaged?This chapter explores attention as a cognitive ability. We specifically address four issues:1.What is attention, and how does it operate during cognition?2.What information-processing models have been devised to understand attention?3.How have new techniques for studying the brain enhanced our understanding ofattention?4.Attention, according to one contemporary theory, is a competition among differentsources of information, all jockeying for further processing. Can such a theory ex-plain both the behavioral and brain perspectives on attention?1.THE NATURE AND ROLES OF ATTENTIONAlthough we have an intuitive understanding of what it means to \u201cpay attention\u201d toan object or event, the study of attention has a long and checkered history in cogni-tive psychology, filled with debate and disagreement. Some have suggested that\u201ceveryone knows what attention is;\u201d others have countered that \u201cno one knows whatattention is\u201d (Pashler, 1998). For example, Moray (1970) proposed six different mean-ings of the term attention,whereas Posner and Boies (1971) suggested that attentionhas three components: orienting to sensory events, detecting signals for focused pro-cessing, and maintaining a vigilant or alert state. Still others have used terms such asarousal, effort, capacity, perceptual set, control,and consciousnessas synonymouswith the process of attention. Adding to the difficulty is the problem of designing andcarrying out careful and systematic studies of attention, for the very reason that at-tentional selection seems to occur so naturally and effortlessly that it is difficult to pindown experimentally.Nonetheless, there is broad agreement that attention involves selecting some in-formation for further processing and inhibiting other information from receivingfurther processing. One possible way to understand how this might work is to ex-plore what happens when attention fails. After this, we will examine what happenswhen attention succeeds. Outlining the failures and successes will allow us to developSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 104REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3419, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c8ba808-a48b-488c-8d1e-142e5909d17c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c8ba808-a48b-488c-8d1e-142e5909d17c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "477dd1b6-f270-4a39-9b20-f525556ed5cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "2ce7b021368c47e6b532f1a95b10ab3f41c0a867abd9117527936f5d9fb8886b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e846846c-be3a-41f1-9a3f-a0fe220c0412", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "6199dc7055aa2a135cf8a3e29b401140b237b382973a66e8162a43b8f3031222", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba4c4fe9-fc60-49f2-90cc-056d58536158", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "640b83113e8a957d0d886d43f51a622b0e7d379c4d368209287d0f24657b5131", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "a clearer idea of what attention is. Thereafter, we will present some theories of atten-tion and some experiments that look at how attention operates in the brain.1.1.Failures of SelectionWhen we fail to attend to information, what kind of information do we miss? One sortof failure occurs when there is a lot of information simultaneously present in front ofyou, as at a party, and you are simply not capable of noticing all of it at once. These fail-ures are referred to as failures of selection in space. Failure can also occur with informa-tion that unfolds in time. When new information (even if only a small amount) arrives ina rapid stream, spending time processing it will cause you to miss some other incominginformation, resulting in what are called failures of selection in time. These failures toattend to information in space or in time are a by-product of a system that prevents usfrom becoming overloaded with irrelevant information\u2014that is, of a system of selectiveattention. As such, these failures are an important part of effective cognitive processingand highlight the function of attention. Later, when we come to theories of attention, itwill be important to remember that understanding attention is as much about informa-tion that is not selected as well as information that is selected. In the following subsec-tions, we provide illustrative examples of failures and successes of attentional selection.1.1.1.Failures of Selection in SpaceFailures of selection in space can be of surprising magnitude. You\u2019d notice, wouldn\u2019tyou, if someone who stopped you on the street to ask for directions suddenly changedinto a different person in the middle of the conversation. Actually, you might not.Demonstrations of the failure to detect changes between flashes of the same scene havenow been replicated many times. Perhaps the most dramatic of these was a demon-stration by Simons and Levin (1998) in which an experimenter stopped pedestrians ona college campus to ask for directions. During each conversation, two people carryinga door walked between the experimenter and the pedestrian. As they did, the experi-menter switched places with a second experimenter who had been concealed behindthe door as it was being carried. This second experimenter then continued the conver-sation with the pedestrian. Only half the pedestrians reported noticing the change ofspeaker\u2014even when they were explicitly asked, \u201cDid you notice that I am not thesame person who first approached you to ask for directions?\u201d This failure to detectchanges in the physical aspects of a scene has been referred to as change blindness(Simons & Rensink, 2005). This phenomenon often goes to the movies: errors in con-tinuity, such as the switch from the breakfast croissant to the pancake in PrettyWoman,go unnoticed by many in the audience. We can also be insensitive to changesin modalities other than vision. It has been shown that we miss changes between voicesin an auditory scene, a phenomenon referred to as change deafness(Vitevitch, 2003).That we miss some perceptual information is interesting. Even more interest-ing from a cognitive perspective is the implication that this does not occur bychance: we are selectingonly partial information from the world around us andare not very attentive to the rest. Change blindness indicates that not all availableinformation is attended and subsequently represented. Fortunately for our evolu-tionary survival, those aspects of the input that are more relevant and meaningful1.

Ifyou\u2019re hungry, you may notice a basket of luscious-looking fruit on a nearby table\u2014but if you\u2019ve just eaten, your attention may glide right over it with barely a pause.Knowledge, beliefs, goals and expectations can alter the speed and accuracy of theprocesses that select meaningful or desired information; that\u2019s what is happeningwhen you rapidly scan a book to find a particular reference and are able to skip overlarge, irrelevant passages of material. The ability to use top-down processing to af-fect selection and attention is highly adaptive and such processing is an efficient wayof extracting critical information from a flood of input.However, because of the wealth of competing stimuli, top-down attentional selec-tion does not always lead immediately to your goal. For example, in the opening sceneat the party, the moment you recognized that the flash of green was your friend\u2019s dresswas probably not the first moment that patch of green had appeared in your visualfield, and the first time you heard your name was probably not the first time yourfriend had called to you. Further, you were actively diverted from looking for yourfriend by the sound of the crashing glass\u2014your top-down processing was overriddenby a sensory event, that is, by bottom-up attentional processing. The result? Failure inspace: attention was captured away from the current goal of seeking your friend.Failures to select information in space can also occur when far fewer stimuli arepresent. For instance, if you are presented with only two sources of informationsimultaneously (say, a drama on television and a story in the newspaper) and arerequired to process both, you will not be able to do them both full justice. The abilityto attend to two sources is impaired compared to the ability to process informationfrom one source alone: there is a cost associated with doing both tasks together.When you try to do both things at once, there are two possibilities: either you willfollow the television plot perfectly and lose the news story altogether (or the otherway round), or you will lose parts of both show and story.Concentration on one source of input to the exclusion of any other is knownas focused attention;in cases of divided attention,in which more than one sourceis attended, the information selected is imperfect (as in the example of followingpartof the newspaper story and partof the television story). One explanation forthe loss of information when attention is divided is that the two sources of infor-mation vie for limited attentional resources, which are sometimes described as\u201cmental effort.\u201d An oversimplified but helpful image is that we each have a poolof attentional effort into which each task taps. The harder the tasks, and the moreof them there are at any one time, the more of such \u201cmental effort\u201d is drawn fromthe pool. When the available capacity is less than that required for completion ofa task, failures are more frequent. When tasks are easier or fewer, there is less de-mand on this limited resource.One clear example of what happens when attention is divided comes from astudy conducted by Neisser and Becklen (1975).

In one, two people were playing a hand game inwhich one player tries to slap the opponent\u2019s hand; in the other, three men werethrowing a basketball and moving about (Figure 3\u20132). When participants were in-structed to track one of the two games, they were successful; but keeping track ofboth games at once was almost impossible.A divided-attention task like this one seems, at first blush, artificial. Yet this isexactly what, after much practice with simulations, highly trained air traffic con-trollers do, with many simultaneous stimuli to monitor (Figure 3\u20133). Fortunately,those who do this kind of work have sufficient expertise and skill that failures areextremely rare.1.1.2.Failures of Selection in TimeJust as there are limitations on the quantity of information that can be processed si-multaneously in space, there are limitations on the speed with which informationcan be processed in temporal sequence. These limitations, of differing degree andquality, apply to everyone.Perhaps the simplest way to determine how fast information can be processed isto ask participants to report the presence of stimuli shown in a rapid sequence. Re-searchers interested in the question of the temporal constraints of attention have de-veloped experiments that push the attentional processing system to its limit.

The interesting finding is that, in the dual-report condition, participantsfailed to report T2 on the occasions when it appeared between about 100 and 500 mil-liseconds after an appearance of T1 (remember, other letters intervene). After greaterdelays between an appearance of T1 and an appearance of T2, however, participantswere again able to spot the T2. The decrease in performance in reporting a T2 if it ap-pears within a certain temporal window following the appearance of a T1 is an in-stance of attentional blink. As the term suggests, attentional blinkis a short periodduring which incoming information is not registered, similar in effect to the physicalblanking out of visual information during the blink of an eye. The phenomenon of at-tentional blink also occurs for two objects (not just letters) that are presented in rapidsuccession (Raymond, 2003). The hallmark of attentional blink is the missed detectionof a stimulus that is presented within a particular time frame after an earlier stimulusis presented. When stimuli are presented so quickly, attention to the first seems to pre-clude attention to the second\u2014showing the failure to select items in time.A similar effect involves the failure to detect objects presented in a rapid sequencewhen some of these stimuli are identical, even when the stimuli are shown for a longenough time to avoid the attentional blink. For example, Kanwisher and colleagues(1997b) showed participants a sequence of nine serially presented displays with twoor three consecutive pictures sandwiched in between visually \u201cnoisy\u201d patterns calledmasks(Figure 3\u20135). A large masking field was also shown at the beginning and endof each trial. Each image was shown for 100 milliseconds. The important finding isthat when the first and third picture in the series were identical, participants weremarkedly less likely to report seeing the third picture (the repeat). This was also truewhen the first and third pictures depicted the same object even if the objects were of\n(a)\n(b)FIGURE 3\u20135A demonstration of repetition blindnessMasks and (center)representational pictures were shown to participants.

When the two pictures wereof different objects, however, participants had no problem identifying the third pic-ture. The failure to detect the later appearance of a stimulus when the stimuli are pre-sented in a rapid sequence has been termed repetition blindness(Kanwisher, 1987).Repetition blindness can occur for words as well as for objects. For example,when the sentence \u201cIt was work time so work had to get done\u201d was presented rap-idly, participants failed to detect the second occurrence of \u201cwork\u201d and recalled thesequence as \u201cIt was work time so had to get done\u201d (Kanwisher, 1991). Blindness toa repetition can also be observed if several words come between the two instances ofthe repeated word or even if they are written in different styles (\u201cWORK\u201d and\u201cwork\u201d). It is believed that the failure to encode the second stimulus occurs becauseit is not individuated or selected as a distinct event when it rapidly follows the first.Instead, the second occurrence is assimilated to the first, and only one event is regis-tered. The phenomenon of repetition blindness suggests that when we do not havemuch time, we do not form a second, separate representation of an object we havejust processed and so are not aware of the repetition.1.1.3.Sources of LimitationWhy do we fail to select information in space or in time? Some have argued that thefailure is on the sensory end; that is, the limitation is, literally, in the eye of the be-holder (or, if the stimuli are auditory, in the ear of the beholder). Human peripheralvision is not very precise, and, in many studies, the information that participantsmiss appears at the edges of the screen. But failures to select all the information pres-ent cannot be explained solely by the drop-off in visual acuity for information ap-pearing farther from the center of the visual field. In the Neisser and Becklen study(with superimposed video sequences), for example, all the necessary information ap-peared in the center of the screen. In the attentional blink and repetition blindnessstudies, the information is also presented in the center of the field. In these circum-stances, then, the failure cannot be one of poor vision. Rather, the limitation appearsto have to do with the quantityof information. Some models propose the notion ofa bottleneck,a  r e s t r i c t i o n  o n  t h e  a m o u n t  o f  i n f o r m a t i o n  t h a t  c a n  b e  p r o c e s s e d  a tonce; because of the bottleneck, certain critical mental operations have to be carriedout sequentially (Pashler & Johnston, 1998).Divided-attention studies demonstrate that performance is hampered when youhave to attend to two separate sources of visual information (like the televisionscreen and the newspaper page) or two separate visual events (the hand-slappinggame and the basketball play). There is also an added cost in accuracy or reactiontime when you attempt to perform two tasks at once. In all these cases, the decre-ment in performance is referred to as dual-task interference.One might wonder whether this decrement occurs because there is too much in-terference when all the information is similar, because it is all visual (or is all uditory)and we simply cannot cope with the quantity of data presented. There is, in fact,greater interference when the sources are both of the same type of information thanwhen they are different (Brooks, 1968). If you are trying to recall a sentence,performing another verbal task such as counting will impair your performance much112CHAPTER 3 AttentionSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 112REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3646, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76ee0326-c10e-4df0-9631-5eddfe8ce15f": {"__data__": {"id_": "76ee0326-c10e-4df0-9631-5eddfe8ce15f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67e3fb2e-c479-4727-af1b-645784a25ca2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "5d58548b113ada4764b59100af6b63afb6883ce595ab083367f4b177541dfc4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bdeff075-c143-499f-ac73-398eddde4eb6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "f9d3be3f53e133942e85bd739b4c3bfae97602496b15fb61afc8227464ec98bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "de07c185-f4da-489a-9da4-bbe52869e639", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "150dcb2bdd83b3eda2bf3490be6992996fe1b550ecff071436febea2ca1bdfb7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1. The Nature and Roles of Attention113more than if you are trying to recall a sentence and examine a picture. By the sametoken, a spatial task such as visualizing a map of the United States and scanningalong its borders, noticing which states are wider than they are tall, would impederecall of a picture but not of a sentence.But the limitation is more general, and the failure to select information can occureven if the two sources of information are of two different types, or even if the infor-mation is presented in two different sensory modalities, say, one auditory and onevisual, although the interference is not as great as when the types of information arethe same. Some investigators believe that the extent of the interference depends onthe extent of the \u201ccross-talk\u201d between the various representations and processesdrawn upon by the incoming information: if similar representations and processes areactivated in the two tasks, they may be confused. For example, both recalling a sen-tence and counting engage verbal representations; these representations may infiltrateeach other and hinder processing. But recalling a sentence and visualizing a map ofthe United States have less overlap of representations and, hence, produce less inter-ference with each other. A practical issue in dual tasking is discussed in the accompa-nying Debatebox.The bottlenecks in attention we have looked at so far have all been perceptual:too many competing stimuli, or fewer stimuli but of the same type and therefore com-peting. A bottleneck in attention can also occur when, even with a single sensory in-put, the outputs required are too great. In such cases, the bottleneck is motor innature. Consider this: You\u2019ve just picked up a ringing phone. The only sensory inputis the sound of the caller\u2019s voice. The call is not for you. Is your roommate around?You have to check. The caller\u2019s in a hurry\u2014can you take a message? Sure\u2014where\u2019sthe pad . . . and while you\u2019re looking you\u2019ve missed the beginning of the message.OK\u2014but now the pencil\u2019s dropped . . . gosh, this is taking a long time. . . . One sen-sory stimulus is requiring a number of responses. Coordinating them will be difficult,and some information will be missed, unless you take all the required responses a lit-tle more slowly or in turn. As with multiple sensory inputs, coordinating two outputresponses is more difficult than simply making a single response. It is not impossibleto do two things at once, and, indeed, we can get better at this with practice, but thereis usually some associated cost or failure even when one is skilled.Just as divided-attention failures, in which sensory information is not attended,do not result from a limitation in vision, the failures in motor output when you tryto do a number of things at once or in quick succession do not result from a limita-tion in the ability to program your muscles to move. Back to the party for a mo-ment: you\u2019ve found your friend and are comfortably chatting. Someone offers youa sandwich, but you\u2019re holding a glass in your right hand, your dominant one. Youhesitate: should you put the glass down (where?) and take the sandwich with yourright hand, or take the sandwich with your left hand? The interference, in the formof a slowing down of your actions, that arises when you try to select between twopossible responses to even a sole sensory stimulus is referred to as a response bot-tleneck.T h e  a d d i t i o n a l  t i m e  n e e d e d  t o  m o v e  t h r o u g h  t h i s  k i n d  o f  b o t t l e n e c k  h a sbeen measured experimentally.

Preliminary experiments determined that it took about 500 milliseconds forparticipants to press the foot pedal after the onset of the tone. If the light flashed (re-quiring the left-hand response) 50 milliseconds before the tone sounded, participantstook even longer than the 500 milliseconds to press the pedal. Response selection forthe tone\u2013pedal could not begin until the response selection for the light had beencompleted, accounting for the additional time to press the pedal (Pashler, 1998).The use of cellular phones has skyrocketed worldwide in the lastfew years. Recent surveys have shown that about 85 percent of cell-phone users in the UnitedStates use a cell phone while driving. Redelmeier and Tibshirani (1997) found that cell-phone usewas associated with a fourfold increase in the likelihood of an accident. (Note that, in many states, it is il-legal to drive and use a handheld phone, which makes sense given the increased risk of accidents whencell phones are used.) What we do not know from this early study is whether the accidents occur more of-ten when people are dialing a number, when they are talking, or when they are reaching for the phone; thatis, whether there is more dual-task interference in some conditions than in others.More recent studies try to sort out these possibilities. For example, Strayer and Johnston (2001) de-signed an experiment in which participants undertook a simulated driving task requiring them to \u201cfollow\u201d atarget car. Participants were assigned randomly to one of three conditions: during the driving task, someparticipants listened to a radio program of their choosing (group 1); others conversed on a cell phone aboutthe presidential election of 2000 or the Olympic games on either a handheld (group 2) or hands-free(group 3) phone. At irregular intervals, a signal flashed red or green; participants were instructed to pressa \u201cbrake\u201d button when they saw a red signal. The experimenters recorded both the number of times theparticipants missed the red signal and the time it took for the individual to press the brake button.The results were straightforward: both cell-phone groups missed the red signal twice as many timesas did the radio group; and when they did spot the signal, their response (measured by the time to pressthe brake button) came later. This lag in response time was more pronounced when the participant wastalking rather than listening. The difference in performance between the radio and cell-phone groups couldnot be explained by different levels of driving skills in the two groups; all participants performed the drivingtask alone (no cell phone) and there was no difference in performance between the groups in this single-task condition. It was only the addition of the cell-phone task that led to the different results.In just what way is attention affected? In a follow-up study, Strayer, Drews, and Johnston (2003)showed that the consequence of adding the task of conducting a phone conversation to the task of driv-ing led the participants to withdraw attention from the visual scene. Participant drivers who held cell-phone conversations missed or had imperfect recall of billboard signs along the route. It turns out thatthese drivers did not really look at the information: the eye movements of drivers who were talking on thephone were not drawn to information along the route, even when it was presented in the center of the vi-sual field and, consequently, they had poorer memory for that information. These failures to process andselect information are very similar to those reported in other experiments on failures to select information;in all cases, the participants could not take in all the visual information that is present and, therefore,focused on only small amounts.Cars and ConversationDEBATESMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 114REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3977, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "645339cb-d8dd-4deb-a6cd-19933475b238": {"__data__": {"id_": "645339cb-d8dd-4deb-a6cd-19933475b238", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30807dd9-9055-40fe-ad8b-c1d8c0032bdb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "36a66e2026fb21355b40718f92561a2769da4aae914834c88165c3522a636715", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "de07c185-f4da-489a-9da4-bbe52869e639", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "fa30d021e5f10abb5eb19fefa9bcaf5d0dd756729609d0fc7380540e5290a643", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c3d4967-a43a-40f7-ac30-8bc3f77b1fca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d3146e6c6ac0bc9002b992c1f3d597ebe69d0d0076ee79a08820762d8d3720aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1. The Nature and Roles of Attention1151.1.4.Problems in InterpretationAlthough cognitive psychologists have spent a great deal of time and effort examiningdivided attention and the costs associated with dual tasks, many questions remain. Forone thing, researchers can never guarantee that the two sources of input are always be-ing attended simultaneously, or that the two outputs are always being selected simulta-neously, or that the two tasks are always performed simultaneously. Even underconditions in which one task apparently demands constant attention (for example, driv-ing), it appears that the same level of attention is not required at every single moment.An effective strategy for multitasking, then, may be simply to switch quickly back andforth between the two tasks (or inputs or responses) rather than try to deal fully withboth simultaneously. But how do you pick your moments? Listening to the car radio fora moment, then watching the road, then listening again is not a very practical (or rec-ommended) procedure, no matter how short each alternate period of attention is! Westill do not know whether it is possible to perform two tasks at exactly the same timeor, if it is, what burden this arrangement places on the cognitive system.A second problem that has muddied the dual-task waters is that it is not possi-ble to guarantee that when you do two things at the same time, you\u2019re doing them inexactly the same way as you would if you were performing each task singly. Severalresearchers have suggested that the participants learn to restructure the two tasksand combine them into a single task (Schmidtke & Heuer, 1997; Spelke et al., 1976).If this is in fact what happens, and the dual tasks morph into a single task, it is dif-ficult to separate out and quantify performance on each of the tasks. Also, in thismorphing, each task has in some way been altered to make the combination possi-ble, and so comparisons of the cost of dual tasks relative to the single task may notbe legitimate.In any event, dual tasking may not be impossible, and one can develop immu-nity to its adverse effects by becoming more proficient at one or both tasks. Let\u2019slook again at the dual task of using a cell phone and driving. Using simulated con-ditions, researchers asked drivers to drive normally and, while doing so, to performa secondary task such as changing the radio station or selecting and calling a num-ber on a cell phone (Wikman et al., 1998). To perform the secondary task, novicedrivers frequently looked away from the road for more than 3 seconds at a time, along (and dangerous) amount of time when you are on the highway. Under the sameconditions, experienced drivers glanced away from the road only for brief periods.Because they were proficient at driving and this skill had become more automatic forthem, the experienced drivers knew how much time they could spend on the sec-ondary task without greatly affecting their driving. With enough practice and expe-rience, a task can become more automatic and, as a result, less interference will beobserved when it is performed in conjunction with another task.In the late 1970s two researchers used just this terminology and described pro-cessing as being either automaticor controlled(Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977). Just asour example of driving experience suggests, they found that people use automaticprocessing on easy or very familiar tasks but are forced to use controlled processingfor difficult or new tasks. However, controlled tasks can also become automatic withpractice over time.SMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 115REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3630, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c3d4967-a43a-40f7-ac30-8bc3f77b1fca": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c3d4967-a43a-40f7-ac30-8bc3f77b1fca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f67706ee-cbf5-474e-b89b-3fb44c9ff0ae", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "f7cb8cca4d629bb218469e2f94e5f8ae9d68395747dc4a02b7dd19c7395f1308", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "645339cb-d8dd-4deb-a6cd-19933475b238", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "36a66e2026fb21355b40718f92561a2769da4aae914834c88165c3522a636715", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce752717-c85c-480f-8e68-db8facb6aaa6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c36dccf1f5b0e0ebb35ac976b09212a8ffa0e4317d6bf8e51010f4fa0e2438c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1.1.5.When the Brain FailsThe failures of selection described so far are part and parcel of the human experi-ence\u2014we have all experienced them at one time or another. This normal pattern offailures, however, is massively exaggerated in those who suffer from hemispatialneglect,a  d e f i c i t  o f  a t t e n t i o n  i n  w h i c h  o n e  e n t i r e  h a l f  o f  a  v i s u a l  s c e n e  i s  s i m p l y  i g -nored. The cause of hemispatial neglect is often a stroke that has interrupted the flowof blood to the right parietal lobe, a region of the brain that is thought to be criticalin attention and selection (Figure 3\u20136a on color insert). When these patients are askedto copy or even draw from memory a clock or a daisy (Figure 3\u20136b on color insert),they do not attend to (that is, they fail to select) information on the side of space op-posite the lesion and so do not incorporate this information in their pictures. Similarly,when they are asked to put a mark through all the lines that they see on a page set be-fore them, their results often show gross disregard of information on the left side: theycancel lines far to the right, as if the left part of the image were simply not there (Figure3\u20136c on color insert). The reason for failure to select the information on the left (op-posite the lesion) is not that they are blind on that side and fail to see the information.Rather, they do not seem to orient toward information on the left side of the scene be-fore them and attend to it. If it is pointed out to them that there is information missingon the left side of their drawing, they may then go back and fill in the missing infor-mation; but, left to their own devices, they apparently do not select information fromthe left side. The neglect is not restricted to visual information (further demonstratingthat it is not a visual problem per se)\u2014such patients may also ignore sounds or touchdelivered to the left side, or even fail to detect smells delivered to the left nostril.Hemispatial neglect can make daily life unpleasant and sometimes dangerous.Patients may eat food from only the right side of the dish, ignoring the food on theleft, and then complain about being hungry. (If the plate is turned around so the re-maining food is on the right side, the problem is rectified.) They may shave or applymakeup to only the right half of the face. They may attend to only the right portionof text, reading a newspaper headlineSPECTACULAR SUNSHINE REPLACES FLOODS IN SOUTHWESTasFLOODS IN SOUTHWESTand may even neglect the left of some words that appear on the right side too, read-ing the title asFLOODS IN SOUTHWESTThey may neglect a left sleeve or slipper, and leave hanging the left earpiece of theireyeglasses (Bartolomeo & Chokron, 2001).People with hemispatial neglect suffer deficits in their mental imagery as well asin perception. Even when there is no sensory input, and the image is solely createdby their own memory, the side opposite the site of damage to the brain is a blank.Bisiach and Luzzatti (1978) demonstrated this by asking a group of hospitalized pa-tients with hemispatial neglect, all of them residents of Milan, to describe in detail116CHAPTER 3 AttentionSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 116REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3271, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce752717-c85c-480f-8e68-db8facb6aaa6": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce752717-c85c-480f-8e68-db8facb6aaa6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ad674758-3d35-4bf2-85a5-310e83f6046b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "336f0f33a0cf0817b3b31104278e67ae4558144808829e90f55f38106ae40f7d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c3d4967-a43a-40f7-ac30-8bc3f77b1fca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "f7cb8cca4d629bb218469e2f94e5f8ae9d68395747dc4a02b7dd19c7395f1308", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e94bb27-8bf2-44dc-8d82-c415f14107b8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "484d7db191c452f3f31a83deebe74c7dc6c2c97ca71df728a8ee46a9c7deb273", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "the Piazza del Duomo, a landmark of their city. Because the piazza was not in sight,this instruction required the patients to generate a mental image of it in order to de-scribe it. Even though the information was being read off entirely from an internalrepresentation and not from sensory input, the patients reported few details on theside of space opposite the damage. This was not the result of memory failure or for-getting: the experimenters then asked the patients to imagine walking around the pi-azza and viewing it from the side of the piazza opposite their point of view in theirfirst mental image. Once again, patients neglected the details on the side of space op-posite their lesion, but now described the buildings and shops they had ignored intheir first description. The finding that hemispatial neglect patients neglect the left oftheir mental images suggests that attention can operate not only to select informationfrom real perceptual input but can also select from a scene that is internally generated.There are some situations in which left-sided information can capture the attentionof the patient with neglect. Very strong and salient information that appears on the neg-lected side of the input may successfully capture the patient\u2019s attention in a bottom-upfashion; a bright light or a sudden sound on the left side may do the trick. Top-downguidance may also be helpful: specifically instructing the patient to attend to the leftmay reduce the extent of the neglect, but such guidance must be frequently reiterated.Although the most obvious deficit in these patients is a failure to attend to left-sided information in space, there is also evidence that there may be a failure to selectinformation in time. For example, Cate and Behrmann (2002) presented letters (suchas an \u201cA\u201d or an \u201cS\u201d) briefly (100-millisecond exposures) on the left and right sides ofa computer screen and asked a patient with left-sided neglect to report which lettersappeared. When a letter was presented alone on the left side, the patient identified 88percent of the letters correctly; this percentage was comparable to the 83 percentreported correctly when the letters appeared alone on the intact right side. The inter-esting finding occurred when both letters were presented together. (In some patients, itis under these dual presentation conditions that the deficit for the left emerges moststrongly.) If the letter on the left appeared first and remained on the screen for about300 milliseconds before the appearance of the right letter, it was reported correctlyalmost as often as when it appeared alone. When the right letter appeared ahead of theleft letter by 300 milliseconds however, the left letter was correctly reported only about25 percent of the time. If, however, the right letter was presented first but enough time,say, 900 milliseconds, elapsed before the left letter appeared, the attraction associatedwith the right letter apparently decayed and the patient was free to attend to the leftletter. In this case, detection went back up to about 80 percent. These results are rem-iniscent of those in the attentional blink experiment.This study makes two important points: (1) When the left letter is on its ownand has no competitor to its right, it can survive the neglect; (2) when a competitoris present on the right, the probability of the left letter\u2019s being detected following ashort temporal interval is reduced because the patient is still attending to the morerightward letter. If enough time passes, however, the patient can attend to the left let-ter once again (Husain et al., 1997). Because the time also affects the outcome, itsuggests that spatial (left\u2013right) and temporal attentional mechanisms interact in de-termining how much information is neglected.1.

Yes, but not many. The explanation usually of-fered lies in the greater, and asymmetric, specialization of brain areas in humans. Inhumans, the areas involved in processing language are generally in the left hemi-sphere, and attentional and spatial processes may therefore have been shifted into theright hemisphere. In humans, then, damage to the right hemisphere gives rise to neg-lect more often and with greater severity than does damage to the left hemisphere.1.2.Successes of SelectionFortunately, the normal attention system is not as dumb as it may appear. Despitethe many failures of selection we are prone to\u2014which may come about because toomuch information is present at any one location, or because too much informationstreams rapidly in time, or because our attention is divided\u2014there are many condi-tions under which we can successfully and efficiently select the necessary informa-tion from the input presented to us.1.2.1.Endogenous and Exogenous Effects in SpaceWhen you were looking for your friend at the party, two kinds of information af-fected your search. One came from within you: your knowledge of the color of herdress. The other came from outside you: the sound of breaking glass. (In this case,knowing the color of dress helped; the glass crash distracted.) These two types ofsources of information have been found to be highly effective determiners of whatinformation is attended.When you came into the room, you searched very broadly and rapidly for allgreen things in the array of colors that surrounded you and then, within this subset ofgreen things, specifically for your friend\u2019s dress. This sort of attentional process, whichhas a voluntary aspect, is top down; it originates from within(from your own knowl-edge, in this case) and hence is called endogenous attention.B u t  t h i s  f o r m  o f  g o a l -driven or top-down attention, can be overridden: salient and powerful stimuli cancapture attention and direct you away from the task at hand. Attention thus capturedis described as exogenous attention,b e c a u s e  i t  i s  d r i v e n  i n  a  b o t t o m - u p  f a s h i o n  b ystimuli generated outsideoneself. (Like the sound of the breaking glass, strong colorcan provide an exogenous cue, and can be very useful: little children on field trips andprisoners in work-release programs wear brightly colored shirts for the same reason.)The most systematic studies that examine endogenous and exogenous formsof attention are based on the idea of covert attention,which was developed byHermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), the German physiologist and physicist.Von Helmholtz demonstrated that although the eyes may be directed at a specific spot,visual attention can be directed elsewhere \u201ccovertly,\u201d that is, without overt motionof the eyes. (Helmholtz achieved his experimental conditions by flashing a spark oflight, which, as a highly salient stimulus, prevented physical motion of his eyestoward the region of space he was attending.)In modern studies, investigators seek to understand how endogenous and ex-ogenous cues influence information processing (Posner et al., 1980, 1982).

The Nature and Roles of Attention119experiment, two boxes appear on a computer screen, one to the right and one to theleft of a central fixation point (Figure 3\u20137a). An endogenous cue such as an arrowleads the participants to focus attention to that location even while their eyes arekept on the fixation point. The arrow is a symbol; only after its meaning is under-stood does a participant know how to shift attention\u2014and hence attention is con-trolled by endogenous processes. On a large proportion of trials (usually around 80percent), designated as \u201cvalid trials,\u201d a target such as a small box is subsequentlypresented at the cued location and participants press a response key as soon as theydetect the presence of the target. In \u201cinvalid trials\u201d an arrow cue appears pointing inthe direction opposite the position of the target. Finally, in other, \u201cneutral,\u201d trials,the target appears at the same location but the arrow is not informative\u2014it pointsboth leftward and rightward.This study produced two main results. First, participants detected the targetfaster (and more accurately) in the valid condition compared to a neutral condition,suggesting that attending to a location can facilitate processing in that location, evenin the absence of eye movements. Second, participants detected the target in the in-validly cued location significantly more slowly than in the neutral condition (and,obviously, more slowly than in the valid condition). What was happening? Theparticipants were deceived or misled by the cue in the \u201cwrong\u201d position, whichguided their attention in a top-down, endogenous fashion; the subsequent shifting ofattention to the other side of the display cost them time. In normal participants, thispattern of costs and benefits is roughly the same whether the target appears on theleft or the right of fixation (Figure 3\u20137b). Data from patients with hemisphericneglect show a very different pattern (see Figure 3\u20137b).Attention is also facilitated by a valid cue and inhibited by an invalid cue whenthe cue is exogenous. An example: this time two boxes are on the screen and onebrightens momentarily, presenting a salient bottom-up cue. The target (e.g., a smallwhite box as in Figure 3\u20137a) then appears in either the cued or the noncued box; inthe neutral condition, both boxes brighten. Attention is automatically drawn to theside of the display with the salient bright box. As with endogenous cuing, the par-ticipants detect the target faster when it appears in the location indicated by the cue(the valid condition) and detect it more slowly in the invalid condition.Although the pattern of findings is very similar in the endogenous and exoge-nous cases, there is one difference. In the exogenous version, attention can be rapidlyand automatically drawn toward the powerfully salient brightening cue and no ex-tra processing time is needed. But exploiting the arrow cue in the endogenous ver-sion requires that participants process the cue perceptually, understand its content,and then use this information in a top-down fashion. If the arrow appears and thetarget follows immediately thereafter, participants show neither the benefit nor thecost of the presence of the cue. Given enough time (perhaps 150 milliseconds) toprocess and implement the information provided by the cue, the facilitation andinhibition emerge clearly.These studies amply demonstrate that facilitation and inhibition of detection areinfluenced by the direction of attention alone, without overt eye movement.

The Nature and Roles of Attention121(such as those described here) to dissociate covert attention and eye movements, un-der more natural circumstances, the two are tightly linked and may even rely on thesame underlying network in the brain (Corbetta & Shulman, 2002). In fact, some re-searchers have suggested that the coupling of attention and eye movements is partic-ularly advantageous: attention can scout the visual scene first and then the eyes canbe moved to regions containing particularly useful or salient information (Hoffman& Subramaniam, 1995).1.2.2.Components of AttentionWhat happens when patients with hemispatial neglect perform this attentional cueingtask? Patients with lesions to the right parietal lobe, many of whom also sufferedhemispatial neglect, detected the valid targets normally on the nonneglected right sideand almost normally on the neglected left side (Posner et al., 1984, 1987). That is, theycould still take advantage of the cue even though their performance was a little poorerwhen the target appeared on the neglected side, and this was true whether the cue wasendogenous or exogenous. In the invalid trials, when the cue occurred on or pointedto the neglected left side but the target appeared on the nonneglected right side, thesepatients detected the target more slowly than in the valid trials. The extent of the slow-ing, however, was in the normal range; neurologically healthy participants, as we haveseen, also showed a cost in the reaction time in invalid trials. The important result isthat in those invalid trials in which the cue occurred on (or pointed to) the non-neglected right side and the target appeared on the neglected left side, the patients withbrain damage needed roughly an additional 500 milliseconds to detect the target.The findings from patients with brain damage led Posner and colleagues to con-struct a model for attention that involves three separate mental operations: disen-gaging of attention from the current location; moving attention to a new location;and engaging attention in a new location to facilitate processing in that location(Posner, 1990; Posner & Cohen, 1984). In the case of the right-hemisphere patients,the model suggests that when the cue directed attention to the nonneglected rightside and the target appeared on the neglected left side, the patients had trouble dis-engaging attention from the good right side, and this deficit produced the dramati-cally slower target-detection times. No \u201cdisengage\u201d problem was apparent for targetson the nonneglected side when the preceding cue indicated the neglected side. In thismodel then, there are several subcomponents of attention, and results indicate thatthe parietal lobe (especially on the right) plays a key role in one of them.Interestingly, Posner and colleagues found other patient groups who appeared tobe impaired in either the \u201cmove\u201d or \u201cengage\u201d operations posited by their attentionmodel. Patients with damage to the midbrain and suffering from a disorder calledprogressive supranuclear palsyseemed to have no difficulty with \u201cdisengage\u201d or\u201cengage\u201d operations (Posner et al., 1985). Rather, they were slow in responding tocued targets in the direction in which they had difficulty orienting, suggesting aproblem in moving attentionto the cued location. On the other hand, patients withlesions to the pulvinar, a part of the thalamus (a subcortical structure), were slow todetect both validly and invalidly cued targets that appeared on the side of space op-posite their lesion, but performed well when the targets appeared on the intact sideSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 121REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3659, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be34f1a7-a241-466c-9066-9f867507332f": {"__data__": {"id_": "be34f1a7-a241-466c-9066-9f867507332f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a912277-3c34-4ebb-ad95-2f4d1a139733", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "afd5f3dbf56482adabf97623fd1198ebc4176fbab98c01f9539b3c3148c108d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "210d7de1-642b-4c95-a50d-9440b677c47b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "cd53d418dd17444c3b10963178acc0c91f830670fd52b9995d95d5b774159371", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cf6ff25c-3c91-43f7-aa2d-e96aecd8f282", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c592afb8a168dcd14beb4d9e1777342afa369d156143ba8681fc8df165e017cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "122CHAPTER 3 Attention(Rafal & Posner, 1987). These results led the researchers to suggest that the thalamicpatients cannot engage attentionon the affected side. The different patterns of per-formance revealed by these three patient groups support the idea that attention canbe decomposed into three separate functions (disengage\u2013move\u2013engage) and thateach can be selectively affected depending on which brain structures are damaged(for an overview, see Robertson & Rafal, 2000).1.2.3.Cross-Modal LinksAlthough many studies have focused on attentional effects in vision, there is alsoevidence that facilitatory and inhibitory effects can be found within and across dif-ferent sensory modalities. Once you spotted your friend at the party visually, yousuddenly heard her calling your name, but it was likely she\u2019d been calling you forsome time. Why did seeing her make her voice more audible?A series of experiments has demonstrated cross-modal priming under both ex-ogenous and endogenous conditions (Driver & Spence, 1998; Kennett et al., 2002).(As noted in Chapter 2, primingoccurs when a stimulus or task facilitates process-ing of a subsequent stimulus or task.) In one experimental design, participants heldtactile stimulators that could vibrate at either the thumb or index finger in eachhand. Four light-emitting diodes were placed in corresponding locations in space.When participants were asked to report the location of the tactile stimulus, the pres-ence of a noninformative visual flash on the same side of space speeded responses.The reverse condition was also true: a random tactile stimulus primed responses tovisual targets on the same side. When participants crossed their hands, the primingwas found to be aligned with external space (that is, the left hand crossed to the rightside of the body primed detection of a visual stimulus on the right). These effectshave also been found between audition and touch, and between audition and vision.Similar cueing effects have been found when participants expect a stimulus in alocation in one modality and an unexpected stimulus appears on the same side ofspace in a different modality. For example, when expecting a visual stimulus on theright, participants are quicker to detect a random tactile event on that side of spacethan one on the left. This finding suggests that directing attention to one side ofspace in one modality automatically results in attention to that location for othermodalities as well.1.2.4.Object-Based AttentionIn life, we are surrounded by objects, animate and inanimate, of all sorts, and attention isdirected toward them as well as to locations in space and positions in temporal sequence.Recent studies of object-based attention show that when attention is directed toward anobject, all the parts of that object are simultaneously selected for processing (e.g., Jaomaszet al., 2005). An immediate example: you think of your friend in green as a single object(and no doubt, because she\u2019s a friend, as greater than the sum of her parts). As you focuson her, you would be more likely to notice the watch on her wrist, because it is a part ofher, than to notice the watch worn by the person standing next to her, even if that personis standing just as close to you as she is\u2014that watch is a part of a different object.SMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/13/06  8:45 AM  Page 122REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3370, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf6ff25c-3c91-43f7-aa2d-e96aecd8f282": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf6ff25c-3c91-43f7-aa2d-e96aecd8f282", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf81f401-01e4-4f8b-baf0-5b12aaf7db4b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "a66f063547b7989a7ca5da793f94f71c69d81e5c5b7b93e5bb9fdb8c0bdb867d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "be34f1a7-a241-466c-9066-9f867507332f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "afd5f3dbf56482adabf97623fd1198ebc4176fbab98c01f9539b3c3148c108d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f89a6a2f-2774-4e67-b796-47f29ca97554", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b0f49bdcb4c2e946844f38cf35abb9c6ff192b791c6af7d02b421ca6e2d0ded", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1.

In fact, participants were almostas good at reporting on the two features as when they were required to make only asingle judgment, on box size orgap side. Similar results were obtained when partic-ipants were asked to make the two judgments about the line itself\u2014was it slanted orupright, was it dashed or dotted? In a further condition, the two judgments the par-ticipants were asked to make concerned the box andthe line, for example, the sizeof the box and the texture of the line. This time, although again no more than twojudgments were required, accuracy fell significantly.The important aspect of this study is that both objects\u2014box and line\u2014were super-imposed one on the other in the center of the screen, thus occupying the same spatial lo-cation. The results with one object (box orline) and two objects (box andline) cannotbe explained by preferential attention to a particular location in space. Instead, the re-sult is compatible with the idea of object-based attention. Apparently, our perceptualsystem can handle two judgments quite well when attention is focused on a single ob-ject. When attention must be divided across two different objects, however, making twojudgments becomes very difficult and performance suffers badly (this is similar to thecost that occurs under dual-task conditions). These findings support the idea that at-tention can be directed to a single object and all features of the object attended.Neuroimaging has confirmed these behavioral results: when we attend to oneaspect of an object, we perforce select the entire object and all its features(O\u2019Craven et al., 1999). Participants were shown pictures of a semitransparent facesuperimposed on a semitransparent house and instructed to fixate on the dot in thecenter of the superimposed images (Figure 3\u20139). On each trial, the position of eitherFIGURE 3\u20138A behavioral demonstration of object-based attentionThese stimuli were used to test whether two features belonging to the same object are processedbetter than two features from different objects (details in text).

The Nature and Roles of Attention125MT). If attention were directed toward a spatial location, then we might haveexpected to see activation in all three brain regions, corresponding to the three stim-ulus types, given that all three occurred in the same region of space. If, however, se-lectively attending to one attribute of an object also enhances processing of otherattributes of the same object, then we would expect greater activation in the brainarea representing co-occurring attributes of the selected object. And, indeed, thatwas the case. When motion was selectively attended, not only was MT activated, asexpected, but the area representing the attended object (face or house) was also ac-tivated. Thus, for example, the fusiform gyrus face area was activated when the facewas moving compared to when it was static, even though the face itself was notpreferentially attended. The same was true for the parahippocampal place areawhen the house moved. This suggests that in object attention, more than one fea-ture is simultaneously selected (say, house-and-moving or face-and-moving) and thecorresponding neural areas reflect this coactivation.Evidence from brain damage also supports the notion of object-based attention.Although hemispatial neglect is predominantly thought of as a deficit in processingin which attention to the left side of space after a right-hemisphere lesion is demon-strably poor, it has been shown that the left side of individual objects is alsoneglected. In one study with neglect patients (Behrmann & Tipper, 1994; Tipper &Behrmann, 1996), participants were shown a static schematic image of a barbell,with each end a different color (Figure 3\u201310). Participants were instructed to press akey when they detected a small white flashing light in either the left or right end ofthe barbell. As expected of patients with left-sided neglect, detection on the left waspoorer than on the right. But was this because the target appeared on the left ofspace(space-based neglect) or because the target appeared on the left of the object(object-based neglect)?In a second condition, while participants watched, the barbell rotated so that theoriginal left end (as identified by its color) appeared on the right of space and theright end of the barbell appeared on the left of space. Surprisingly, when the target\u2014the flashing light\u2014appeared on participants\u2019 \u201cgood\u201d side, the right of space (but inthe end of the barbell that had previously appeared on the left), participants tooklonger to detect its presence. The poorer detection in the rotating case occurred pre-sumably because the target fell on what had been the left end of the barbell. Simi-larly, when the target appeared on the left of space, performance was better than inthe static condition, because it now fell on the right end of the object. A further, andimportant, finding was that when the two circles that depicted the ends of the bar-bell were not joined by a connecting bar, participants\u2019 detection of targets on theright of space was always good and detection of targets on the left of space was al-ways poor. In other words, no object-based neglect occurred, presumably becausethe two circles were not perceived as two ends of a single object; therefore, onlyspace- and not object-based attention operated.An even more extreme case of object-based selection\u2014or rather its deficit\u2014can beseen in patients with B\u00e1lint\u2019s syndrome (for more information about this syndrome,see Rafal, 2001).

The Nature and Roles of Attention127and a whole object (a line drawing) may be neglected even if it occupies the samespatial position as another drawn object. These patients are able to perceive only oneobject at a time; it is as if one object captures attention and precludes processing ofany others.However, the failure to select more than one object can be reduced if the objectsare grouped perceptually. In one such study (Figure 3\u201311), Humphreys and Riddoch(1993) had two patients with simultanagnosia view a display containing colored cir-cles (each itself an object). On some trials, the circles were all the same color and onother trials half the circles were one color, half another. The patients were to reportwhether the circles in a display were all the same color or were of two different col-ors. In some displays, the circles were unconnected (the random condition); in oth-ers, circles of the same color were connected by lines, and in still others (the singlecondition), circles of different colors were connected (the mixed condition). In dis-plays of unconnected circles, the patients found it difficult to judge color, especiallywhen there were two circles of different color\u2014there were just too many differentobjects. If, however, the two differently colored circles formed a single object byvirtue of a connecting line, some of the difficulty of attending to each circle sepa-rately was offset, and the patients did better in the mixed condition than in the othertwo conditions. The cost of dividing attention between differently colored circleswas reduced when these circles were joined to make a single object, and this im-provement was more dramatic than in either the random or single condition.\nFIGURE 3\u201311SimultanagnosiaPatients with simultanagnosia can attend to only a single object at a time; these patients can behelped when information in the visual scene is bound together to make a single object. Patients wereshown displays with circles of two different colors, some disconnected (the random condition), somelinked according to color (the single condition), and some in which differently colored circles wereconnected (the mixed condition). Joining the circles (thus making them into single objects) made iteasier for these participants to perform the task of judging whether one or two colors were present;joining circles of two different colors (the mixed condition) led to the most improved performance.Random Condition Single Condition Mixed ConditionSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 127REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2558, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1231a3c8-9f22-454b-b482-2dcdcba9f0e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "1231a3c8-9f22-454b-b482-2dcdcba9f0e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "903d4ea0-a13b-4631-81c6-a7ef809c6305", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "28c2cb86ed4d4e4ba0a991a81bdeed332ace9acba29cf0ee49d130ac582f24a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e70c241-aaf9-4f3f-81bf-5a98fdc8bbc9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "ccbb8d6a1e8bb97ad2f491fabbafa3c7abac12d93c8a16199ae146fece110d44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cfb6fc93-8594-4833-b473-7e84d129b40c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "52bc5dab3c27fc645a230f7827ed44bd9914071b64f69adcef5e329a8160ccd3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "128CHAPTER 3 AttentionComprehension Check:1.Selection of information can fail when too much information is present at anyone time or when information comes in faster than we can process it. What aresome examples of failures in space and in time?2.What are the distinctions between exogenous and endogenous forms of atten-tion?2.EXPLAINING ATTENTION: INFORMATION-PROCESSING THEORIES\u201cPaying attention\u201d encompasses dynamic processes that involve the enhancement orselection of particular information and the inhibition of other information. Atten-tion may be thought of as a mechanism that controls processing so that we are notoverwhelmed by too much information. Endogenous factors such as one\u2019s knowl-edge and goals and exogenous factors such as the salience of external informationcan influence the selection. But how does attention work? A number of differentinformation-processing theories have attempted to capture the dynamics of atten-tional effects. Although none of these theories can explain all the attentional phe-nomena we have described so far, the theories offer important insights into theprinciples that underlie attentional effects.2.1.Early versus Late Attentional SelectionAlmost all the experiments described here show that we can attend only to some ofthe sensory information that surrounds us and not to all of it. In the language of in-formation processing, this selective aspect of attention is often a consequence of in-adequate channel capacity or a fundamental limitation in the flow of information.One question is, when does selection occur, early or late in processing? Where is thebottleneck? How much and what kind of information is processed before it, howmuch and what kind after it? That essentially is the problem of \u201cearly versus lateattentional selection.\u201dThe British psychologist Donald Broadbent (1926\u20131993) favored the view thatselection is made at an early stage of processing. He proposed a model of the atten-tional system as containing a limited-capacity channel through which only a certainamount of information could pass (Broadbent, 1958). The many sensory inputs ca-pable of entering later phases of processing, he believed, had to be screened to letonly the most important information through. In his view, at an early stage of pro-cessing, information comes into a very brief sensory store in which physical charac-teristics of the input are analyzed: in the visual modality, these characteristics aremotion, color, shape, spatial location; in the auditory modality, pitch, loudness, and,again, spatial location. Broadbent argued that the bottleneck is immediately after thesensory store, and only a small amount of information, selected on the basis of phys-ical characteristics, passes through for further, semantic processing./checkbldSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 128REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2852, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfb6fc93-8594-4833-b473-7e84d129b40c": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfb6fc93-8594-4833-b473-7e84d129b40c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "48856e61-2730-484a-a35c-77ed04809166", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "ea7d3a16b6aa7dddefedc554fa9eaa592e677909cca44872405a7fb9db210f81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1231a3c8-9f22-454b-b482-2dcdcba9f0e1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "28c2cb86ed4d4e4ba0a991a81bdeed332ace9acba29cf0ee49d130ac582f24a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "23fc9456-0976-408a-8880-9acf65202b65", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8faf21080064b67d3cc72ad21a9adb44b76328f07722afe5ea76425bf3c9fa4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "2. Explaining Attention: Behaviorally Based Theories129Broadbent\u2019s ideas were well received at the time; they successfully accounted fora range of empirical evidence. Some of this evidence had been presented by E. ColinCherry (1953), another British psychologist, who recruited volunteers to participatein an auditory experiment. Using a technique called dichotic listening(the literalmeaning is listening with \u201ctwo ears\u201d), he played competing speech inputs throughheadphones to the two ears of his participants. For example, the right ear mightreceive \u201cthe steamboat chugged into the harbor\u201d while the left ear simultaneouslyreceived \u201cthe schoolyard was filled with children.\u201d Cherry instructed participants to\u201cshadow,\u201d that is, to follow and repeat as rapidly as possible one stream of speechinput and to ignore the other. Cherry found that participants had no memory ofwhat was played in the unattended ear; in fact, they did not even notice if the unat-tended message switched to another language or if the message was played back-ward. They did, however, notice whether the sex of the speaker was different orwhether the speech became a pure tone.Cherry\u2019s results (1953) are consistent with the early-selection bottleneck theory:unattended inputs are filtered out and attended signals are admitted through on thebasis of their physical characteristics. Changes in the physical aspects of a stimuluswere attended, but if there were no such changes, the stimulus would either be at-tended or filtered out. Consistent with the claim that unattended stimuli are filtered,when the same word list was played to the unattended ear of participants 35 times(Moray, 1959), the participants never noticed. The failure to detect the repeatedword lists indicates that the unattended signals were not processed deeply and theparticipants did not have a representation of the words or their meaning.But one important piece of evidence suggests that a theory of early selection can-not be the whole story. Only a theory of late selection\u2014which holds that, before thebottleneck, allinformation is processed perceptually to determine both physicalcharacteristics andsemantic content\u2014could account for the finding that some infor-mation couldbe detected in the unattended channel even when there was no changein its physical features. This was especially true if the information was salient andimportant to the participant. Hearing your friend call your name above the din ofthe party is a good example of how unattended but high-priority information canstill be detected. Hearing your name at a loud party is such a good example of thisphenomenon that it\u2019s known as the cocktail party effect. By early-selection views, thecocktail party effect should not be possible; but there it is. Because it now seemedthat unattended inputs were able to intrude and capture attention, Broadbent\u2019s ideashad to be modified.Additional evidence to support late selection came from a number of studies us-ing dichotic listening. In one (Treisman, 1960), a different message was played intoeach ear of participants. The logical content of each, however, was confused: theleft ear heard \u201cIf you are creaming butter and piccolos, clarinets, and tubas seldomplay solos\u201d; the right ear heard \u201cMany orchestral instruments, such as sugar, it\u2019s agood idea to use a low mixer speed.\u201d Participants were told to shadow the right ear,but some must have switched channels to follow meaning: they reported a reason-able sentence about an orchestra, and believed they had shadowed the correct earall along.SMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 129REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3625, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23fc9456-0976-408a-8880-9acf65202b65": {"__data__": {"id_": "23fc9456-0976-408a-8880-9acf65202b65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f58d5ca2-927e-4bc5-861c-0b22198ff7a1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "6d4ce1baf2f09c059f2c0807f24ec36bc658cefc15a44e00631bcaccbafe79de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cfb6fc93-8594-4833-b473-7e84d129b40c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "ea7d3a16b6aa7dddefedc554fa9eaa592e677909cca44872405a7fb9db210f81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a2c0574c-5c42-46db-be01-936502116136", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "20a998c548dd3c02e84d75a9c7baf7d2dec376629b62361c7ac36d03556404bf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "130CHAPTER 3 AttentionThe late-selection idea was also tested by presenting a participant\u2019s own nameon the unattended channel, a controlled equivalent of the cocktail party effect(Wood & Cowan, 1995). About one-third of the participants reported hearing theirown name (and none reported hearing a different name). This finding is difficult toaccommodate within the early-selection view; it is also difficult to accommodate itentirely within the late-selection view, because only one-third of the participants de-tected their names on the unattended channel. One possible explanation is that thisone-third occasionally switched attention to the unattended channel. This may in-deed be what happened: when Wood and Cowan instructed participants ahead oftime to be ready for new instructions during the task, 80 percent of the participantsnow heard their name on the unattended channel. This finding undermines lateselection and suggests that participants may, for one reason or another, switchattention to the other channel despite instructions.How can we reconcile these various results? One suggestion is that some kind ofanalysis must be done before the bottleneck, or filter, so that one\u2019s own name orother salient information can pass through (Moray, 1970). Arguing against this, an-other suggestion holds that the early-selection view requires only a slight modifica-tion (Treisman, 1969): that in each person\u2019s \u201cdictionary,\u201d or lexical store, somewords have lower thresholds of activation than others. Thus, information is still fil-tered out early, but words that are well known by the listener are more easily de-tected and require less analysis\u2014and hence the information that does get throughthe filter is sufficient. Thus, one\u2019s own name or a shouted \u201cFire!\u201d would appear topass through the bottleneck and capture the listener\u2019s attention. Also, words that arehighly probable given the semantic context (such as piccolofollowing shortly afterinstruments) may also pass through to our awareness.2.2.Spotlight TheoryLike a spotlight that highlights information within its beam, in this view, spatial at-tention selectively brings information within a circumscribed region of space toawareness, and information outside that region is more likely to be ignored. Thismetaphor works\u2014up to a point.Consistent with the idea that spatial locations can be enhanced when they fall inand around the spotlight, participants who correctly named letters appearing at mul-tiple locations in the visual field were more likely to succeed at an orientation dis-crimination task when the forms to be discriminated appeared near the letters. Thesedata (Hoffman & Nelson, 1981) suggest that information is enhanced when it ap-pears near the current position of the spotlight.But the spotlight metaphor breaks down. For one thing, a number of experiments,discussed earlier, have shown that attention can be directed to a single object, even if su-perimposed on another object, demolishing the idea that a \u201cspotlight\u201d of attentionhighlights information in a particular spatial region. If that were true, all objects wouldbe selected together, but we know that one object can be preferentially selected. Anotherdifficulty is the assumption of the spotlight model that the beam of attention sweepsthrough space. If that\u2019s what happens, one would expect that if an obstacle intervenedSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 130REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3430, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2c0574c-5c42-46db-be01-936502116136": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2c0574c-5c42-46db-be01-936502116136", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c1860dfa-8ed7-46bc-b8fe-4887d2442d78", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "38427449ff8ac4fa41074479e8c1fef2cca4cd65c8fdf24a4d39d82886cdf854", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "23fc9456-0976-408a-8880-9acf65202b65", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "6d4ce1baf2f09c059f2c0807f24ec36bc658cefc15a44e00631bcaccbafe79de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a326b81b-c1a8-4b38-a209-d43c17389c59", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e225d333bad484e3e916f386bb23d9d8849d3d3c6ee541230a81b44848c2955", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "2. Explaining Attention: Behaviorally Based Theories131in the course of the sweep, attention would be captured or hampered by this obstacle.But it isn\u2019t. In a study that investigated this expectation (Sperling & Weichselgartner,1995), participants monitored a stream of digitsappearing at a fixation point. At thesame time, they were to attend to a rapidly changing stream of lettersappearing to theleft of the fixation point and to report any appearance of the letter \u201cC.\u201d Occasionallyanother character appeared between the fixation stream and the letters on the left\u2014thatis, it interfered with any \u201cspotlight beam.\u201d But this \u201cinterference\u201d made no difference:whether or not intervening information appeared, the time taken to detect a letter \u201cC\u201dwas constant. These results suggest that attention is not influenced by the presence ofspatially intervening information, as would be expected from a spotlight model.Rather than thinking about attention as a spotlight where information outside theselected region is simply ignored, more recent studies have begun to characterize atten-tion as a dynamic process in which information selection is automatically accompaniedby active inhibition of other information. Thus, rather than as a spotlight, attention canbe understood as a competitive system in which tuning into one thing results in the in-hibition of competing information. Attending to green things will result in inhibition ofthings of other colors (helping you find your friend on our party example), attending toa single object such as a person will result in inhibition of other people or objects, at-tending closely to music may inhibit to some degree unrelated visual information.Attention, then, is a dynamic push\u2013pull process that involves both increasing and de-creasing the likelihood that certain locations or objects will be processed in detail. Theseideas are elaborated in greater detail in the final section of this chapter.2.3.Feature Integration Theory and Guided SearchThis theory, which has a very different emphasis from ideas of bottlenecks, filters,and spotlights, is mostly concerned with the role attention plays in selecting andbinding complex information. This question has been particularly well investigatedin experiments using a visual search task. In this design, a display is presented on acomputer screen; participants are instructed to find a target piece of informationand press a response key when they do. For example, participants may be in-structed to search for the circle in a display such as that shown in Figure 3\u201312a.

Try it: the difference between these two typesof trials will be immediately apparent. It is absurdly easy to locate the target on theleft, but the display on the right poses more difficulty. Displays like that on the leftare referred to as disjunctive(or feature)searchtrials. In these trials the target dif-fers from the other characters or symbols\u2014the distractors\u2014by a single feature,such as shape (circle among squares). A distractoris a nonrelevant stimulus that issupposed to be ignored. Displays such as the one in Figure 3\u201312b are conjunctivesearchtrials, in which the target is defined by a conjunction of features\u2014here, (blueversus white) and shape (circle versus square).Your experience with Figure 3\u201312 no doubt suggested that disjunctive search isgenerally easier; you\u2019re right. Even increasing the number of elements in the displayin disjunctive search does not slow down target detection\u2014the search can be doneeffortlessly and rapidly. The target seems to pop out at you; this kind of search isdescribed as preattentive;that is, it takes place before attention is engaged. Becausethe target pops out regardless of the number of elements in the display, it is likelythat the search is conducted in parallel across the display; that is, all elements areevaluated at the same time. In conjunctive search, however, each element must beattended and evaluated individually to determine whether or not it is the target.Adding more elements to conjunctive search slows you down substantially and, infact, an additional increment of time is required to detect the target for each addi-tional item included in the display. Because you must examine each item serially tosee whether it has the requisite conjunction of attributes, the time to find the targetincreases dramatically as the number of distractors increases.The cognitive difference between disjunctive and conjunctive search is wellcaptured by feature integration theory (FIT) (Treisman & Gelade, 1980). Accord-ing to FIT, the perceptual system is divided into separate maps, each of which reg-isters the presence of a different visual feature: color, edges, shapes. Each mapcontains information about the location of the features it represents. Thus, theshape map of the display in Figure 3\u201312a would contain information about some-thing of a particular shape at the right of the screen. If you know that you are look-ing for a target defined by that shape, you need only refer to the shape map, whichcontains all the shapes present in the display. The shape you are looking for willpop out of this shape map and target detection proceeds apace, irrespective of thenumber of distractors of another shape. Looking for a conjunctive target, however,requires the joint consultation of two maps, the shape map and the color map.

For example, participants sometimes make illusoryconjunctions,t h a t  i s ,  i n c o r r e c t  c o m b i n a t i o n s  o f  f e a t u r e s .

This response, incorrectlycombining features (COLORness and squareness) present in the display, suggeststhat these features are registered separately but that they are not properly bound to-gether. When attention is overloaded or the features are not selected together, the iso-lated features remain unbound and may be incorrectly attached to other features(Treisman & Schmidt, 1982).Do brain studies support the distinction between disjunctive and conjunctiveprocesses? Some neuroimaging studies have indicated that different types of featuresreally are being registered by partially distinct neural mechanisms, as assumed byfeature integration theory. But the evidence is not incontrovertible, and some find-ings from patients with hemispatial neglect present a challenge to FIT. Patients withhemispatial neglect fail to take into account information on the side of space oppo-site the lesion, and the deficit has been assumed to be one of failing to attend to thatside. According to FIT, disjunctive search is preattentive and does not engage atten-tion, whereas conjunctive search does involve attention. If this distinction is correct,then one might predict that neglect patients would be able to perform disjunctivesearch well, even when the target appears on the neglected side. The findings suggestthat this is not true. Behrmann and colleagues (2003) tested the visual search per-formance of a large group of neglect patients on the \u201cQ\u201ds and \u201cO\u201ds search task, ma-nipulating the number of elements in the display from 1 to 16 items. As expected,these patients took a very long time, compared with control participants, to detectthe presence of the \u201cO\u201d among the \u201cQ\u201ds on the right side (remember, this is themore difficult search, for the absenceof a feature).

Consequently, a new the-ory, guided search,was proposed (Wolfe, 2003; Wolfe et al., 1989). As indicatedby the name, output from a first stage of information processing \u201cguides\u201d later se-rial search mechanisms. Although the first stage is similar to that of FIT in that itis constructed of different feature maps, it differs in that items that cannot possi-bly be the target are eliminated in parallel in the feature maps. In the example ofFigure 3\u201312, processing within the color feature map would label all the whiteitems as distractors and all the color items as potential targets. The same sort oflabeling would occur for the square versus circle stimuli within a shape featuremap. Thus, by the time information reaches the second attentive stage, the numberof candidate targets is already much reduced compared to the total number ofitems possessing one feature of the target. Guided searching accounts for a relativelyefficient search of conjunction targets by allowing information from the preattentivefeature stage to reduce the number of items over which attentionally demandingserial searches occur.Comprehension Check:1.What are the differences between a spotlight view of attention and a feature in-tegration view of attention?2.Distinguish between \u201cattention operating early\u201d and \u201cattention operating late\u201dand provide examples of studies that support each of these two views.3.LOOKING TO THE BRAINThe study of attention has become a very hot topic in the twenty-first century be-cause of a number of very successful studies of the neural basis of attention. Thesein turn have furthered our knowledge of the mechanisms that give rise to atten-tion. For example, it is now a well established behavioral finding that when at-tention is directed to a location, perception of that information is enhanced. Untilfairly recently, however, we did not know whether this was because the target atthe cued location was more efficiently processed in the visual areas of the brain orbecause the motor system was biased to produce faster responses. Both these ex-planations are reasonable accounts of the findings of faster target detection. Toexplore further, researchers have conducted attention studies with animals andhumans using various biological methods.134CHAPTER 3 Attention\n/checkbldSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/13/06  8:45 AM  Page 134REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2930, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad8866da-dba2-4824-bb28-3a144769cf35": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad8866da-dba2-4824-bb28-3a144769cf35", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a774717-8e6e-42b7-b588-5fd9de17add7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "9f2db0ca80de7b67f9eb0d41b540fdf813be55b3d416e632c2d07c98fe43075a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "19273e59-a942-41f7-b7c3-ac26fec47b6c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "057b7341c3cfaaf13e5e2815f4345d2bd5b5bb67288ca7ca7a8296beb3e1856b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "71193de8-3b3f-45aa-a368-df85e92cd9f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "385be4cf24189f78729986d533b74b2fc6297ff554e2f5f3a62d48a9021d3234", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "3. Looking to the Brain1353.1.Electrophysiology and Human AttentionIn the late 1960s, technology was developed that allowed researchers to measurewith considerable precision the variation in electrical activity generated by thebrain. Although it was known that faint waves are emitted by the brain in responseto a stimulus, it had not previously been possible to average these tiny signals andrelate them specifically to the processing of that stimulus. More sensitive electrodesplaced on the scalp and more powerful computers to make the calculations coulddo the job. With technological advances, it became possible to distinguish betweenan event-related potential (ERP)\u2014the change in electrical activity in response to astimulus\u2014and the sorts of brain activity that go on all the time. Investigators werenow able to explore the neural mechanisms associated with various cognitiveprocesses, including the phenomenon of selective attention.The major result from some of these ERP studies was that directing attention to-ward a stimulus results in an increase in the amplitude of the waveform as early as70 to 90 milliseconds after the onset of the stimulus. These changes are recorded inthe first positive, or P1, wave over lateral occipital regions of the scalp (in the visualsystem) and suggest that attention enhances the early processing of visual stimuli inthe brain, which leads to better perceptual detection of the attended target stimulus.For example, a study that recorded ERPs during tasks involving covert attentionalcueing (such as that depicted in Figure 3\u20137) found a difference in the P1 waveform(and also in the first negative wave, N1) between cued and uncued trials for targetsin both the left and right visual fields. Larger sensory ERPs were recorded in earlystages of visual processing when the targets were in cued locations (Mangun &Hillyard, 1991). Attending to a location apparently increased the amount of visualprocessing, giving rise to a larger ERP signal. A similar increase in the sensory ERPoccurs when attention is exogenously drawn to a location if the target appearswithin 300 milliseconds of the exogenous cue. Again, an early occipital wave is en-hanced, consistent with enhanced visual processing of the target.Taken together, these results suggest that exogenous, automatic attention andendogenous, voluntary attention (in other words, bottom-up and top-down forms ofattention) have at least some underlying processes in common, an implication con-sistent with the behavioral findings discussed earlier. Furthermore, the enlargementof early waveforms at the occipital cortex is consistent with the idea that selectionoccurs early in the processing stream and that incoming sensory signals may be en-hanced early as a result of attention. But, as we will see, some attentional processingmay also occur later.Interestingly, just as cross-modal links confer benefits in behavioral tasks, inter-actions between different primary sensory areas revealed by ERP studies have simi-lar effects. For example, paying attention to either an auditory or a tactile stimulusappearing on one side of space resulted in enhanced ERPs within the first 200 mil-liseconds at electrodes in primary visual areas. Thus, attending to one side of spacein the tactile orthe auditory domain automatically resulted in enhanced attention tovisual information on that side. This result indicates that when a salient event takesplace at a given location in one modality, spatial attention is directed to that locationSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 135REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3588, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71193de8-3b3f-45aa-a368-df85e92cd9f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "71193de8-3b3f-45aa-a368-df85e92cd9f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7115346c-8ca3-4ce8-b652-76d8bab98b08", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "c5192a4131bf88bed0abc14dff8d5ca4b629e500b42b65c4be017a57bf7b7576", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad8866da-dba2-4824-bb28-3a144769cf35", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "9f2db0ca80de7b67f9eb0d41b540fdf813be55b3d416e632c2d07c98fe43075a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d2e7341-bf0a-456c-8533-141635c5a212", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2572f2e0b509d447819fd272efdc29a66742960005ab9ac7f29685022345caf6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "136CHAPTER 3 Attentionin other modalities as well (Eimer & Driver, 2001; Eimer et al., 2002). This seems tobe a very efficient way of wiring up the attentional system, and the result at acrowded party is that when you spot your friend visually, you are better able to hearand localize the sound of your own name.3.2.Functional Neuroimaging and Transcranial Magnetic StimulationData from ERP studies have been very useful in demonstrating that some atten-tional modulation occurs during the first phases of cortical processing, and inshowing similarities across endogenous and exogenous cueing and across visual,auditory, and tactile domains. These data have been able to do this because of thetemporal precision of the ERP technique, allowing measurement of changes inbrain waves over time even down to a matter of milliseconds. But ERP methodsare not that good at indicating exactly which region of the brain is responsible forgenerating the brain waves. Because the electrodes are placed on the head and thepotentials are recorded at the surface of the scalp, we can never be perfectly sureof the location of the brain region producing the potentials. Functional neu-roimaging serves as a good complementary approach: its temporal precision isnot as good as that achieved by ERP methods, but its spatial precision is far bet-ter. The two main functional neuroimaging methods, positron emission tomogra-phy (PET) and fMRI, measure blood flow or metabolism in very particularregions of the brain. Their use in attention studies can demonstrate the regionalconsequences of attending to a stimulus. (For a fuller discussion of methodologi-cal issues, see Chapter 1, Section 4.)In one of the early PET studies, participants were required to shift attention be-tween locations\u2014in this case, boxes aligned horizontally across the visual field\u2014andto press a button when a target appeared in one or the other of the boxes (Corbetta,et al., 1993). The experimenters found that the superior (i.e., upper) parietal lobe inthe right hemisphere was consistently activated during attentional shifts comparedto periods when fixation was maintained in the middle of the screen (Corbetta et al.,1993; Vandenberghe et al., 2001). The involvement of the superior parietal lobe wasalso evident in another visual search study, especially when the target contained aconjunction of features. Although other regions of the brain, including the basal gan-glia, thalamus, insular cortex, frontal cortex, and the anterior cingulate, also showenhanced activation during attentional switching in visual search tasks, the parietallobe seems to play the primary role.Another experimental design used PET to monitor brain activation as partici-pants inspected an image for a change in either its color, motion, or shape (Corbettaet al., 1990). In addition to the parietal cortex, brain areas associated with process-ing motion were activated when participants attended to motion. Similarly, whenparticipants attended to color, brain areas associated with color were activated.

For example, Corbetta and Shulman (2002) showed that different neuralsystems are used when attention is directed to a location before the appearance of astimulus (an endogenous condition) and when an unexpected salient stimulus appears(an exogenous condition) and redirects a participant\u2019s attention. They found that incases of endogenous attentional orientation, a network of frontal and dorsal parietalareas (including the intraparietal sulcus, IPS; superior parietal lobule, SPL; and thefrontal eye fields, FEF) was involved. Searching for your friend in a crowded room in-volved voluntary reorientation of attention that would activate this frontoparietal net-work of brain areas. On the other hand, effects involving exogenous mechanisms ofattention, such as those arising from the harsh sound of shattering glass, were foundto activate a more ventral system that included the temporal parietal junction (TPJ)and ventral frontal cortex. The authors hypothesized that this latter system is involvedin the detection of unexpected salient or novel information.

Conversely, information about the importance of thestimulus from the voluntary system may modulate the sensitivity of the ventral system,providing a top-down way for your intentions or goals to influence how strongly yourattentional system will be distracted by exogenous information.The notion that attention operates over time as well as over space\u2014for which thereis behavioral evidence from studies on attentional blink and repetition blindness\u2014issupported by evidence from neuroimaging. You\u2019ve been looking for your friend forsome time without success. Have you missed her? Has she left? Some people are begin-ning to leave the party. As more and more people start looking for their coats, you be-come ever more vigilant in looking for a patch of green. Such expectations for theappearance of a stimulus in time have also been reflected in activation of the fron-toparietal brain areas, suggesting that the voluntary attentional neural network oper-ates temporally as well as spatially (Coull et al., 2000; Wojciulik & Kanwisher, 1999).It is probably not surprising that after damage to this region, patients not only are im-paired in attending to information on the side of space opposite the lesion (as in hemis-patial neglect), they are also impaired in attending to information that is presented in arapid temporal stream.Evidence from a completely different technique, transcranial magnetic imaging(TMS), has also confirmed the critical role of parietal cortex in attention. Thistechnique, which was also discussed in Chapter 1, allows a magnetic field to bepassed through the neurons in a particular region of the brain, putting thoseneurons into a state in which they are inhibited from being activated by incomingstimuli. This technique, which is used with nonneurological participants, in effectinduces a temporary \u201clesion\u201d in healthy brains lasting a few seconds or minutes(with no demonstrable consequences after the study is completed). TMS studieswith normal participants can therefore be thought of as analogous to studies ofpatients with damage to specific regions of the brain (such as patients withhemispatial neglect). TMS applied to the right parietal cortex of normal partici-pants led them to require more time for conjunctive search but not for searches forsimple features (Ashbridge et al., 1997). (Recall from earlier in the chapter thatconjunctive search, but not simple-feature search, requires attention.) Interestingly,this increased time to search after TMS can be eliminated by training participantson the conjunctive search task (Walsh et al., 1998), perhaps thus making it moreautomatic and less demanding of attention. Another TMS study, which disruptedthe IPS in one or the other brain hemisphere, resulted in impaired detection of stim-uli on the side of space opposite the site of TMS; but this was true only when twostimuli were presented, one on the left and one on the right (Hilgetag et al., 2001).Together these studies appear to support the idea that the superior and posteriorparietal lobes are involved in attentional shifts, and that damage to these areasresults in a bias for attention to be directed to the side of space that is registered bythe \u201cintact\u201d hemisphere, as is true in hemispatial neglect.The ERP studies provide much support for early selection and enhancement ofvisual cortex processing during periods of attention; the PET and fMRI studiesSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 138REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3690, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "929accfd-a491-4d4e-9fec-3187256921fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "929accfd-a491-4d4e-9fec-3187256921fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f61f8e8d-5a4f-4062-b706-9721e410aae0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "b52012e70727303b2e9b40a208ea07af31fcb75c00f9cd9da54057cab1df870e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a64a8020-bad0-4e9d-83e2-dfa164aec68d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "9bca0d75d5a97f7d51e9aba2c4146f1cb3171353795c852c8ae7b6e689c49ef6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c68f41e9-a3ef-4b6d-bcd0-6c412530ee5b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "887233f33285afda24230279d30c4a023f1e7615993dee7d995b24db817e6916", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "4. Competition: A Single Explanatory Framework for Attention?139indicate that many other areas of cortex are activated as well in attention. These in-clude parietal cortex and frontal cortex; imaging studies have also shown activationin occipital cortex, confirming the ERP studies (Gandhi, et al., 1999). The most im-portant message from these studies is that attention does not simply engage one areaof the brain. Rather, attention is implemented in a wide, distributed circuit to whichdifferent brain regions contribute. \u201cAttention\u201d involves selection that can occurearly, late, or at both times, and be driven by our will or by the strength of stimuli inthe environment and on the basis of space or objects or time. And so the most fruit-ful way of thinking about attention is as a dynamic system that flexibly allows forselection in many different ways. These studies of neural systems in the human braincomplement the behavioral studies described in previous sections.Comprehension Check:1.Describe two different methods that have been used to study the brain basis ofattention.2.Do the ERP studies support an early or a late view of attentional selection? Inprinciple, could ERP results provide support for both views? If so, how? If not,why not?4.COMPETITION: A SINGLE EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK FOR ATTENTION?Conceptualizations of selective attention have undergone many transformationsover the history of attention studies. Early theories drew analogies between atten-tion and a filtering mechanism or bottleneck that operated in accordance with a setof early perceptual or later semantic criteria. Later theories recast attention as theselective distribution of a limited amount of cognitive resources. Now attentionwas seen not as a discrete gateway or bottleneck but as a modulatory influencethat could increase or decrease the efficiency with which demanding processing isperformed. Considered in this way, attention is a far more flexible mechanism\u2014capable of facilitating or inhibiting processing of the input\u2014than a simple spotlightor filter. Data from many differently designed studies have suggested ways in whichattention may be implemented in the brain; many different brain areas, from theposterior occipital lobe, to the anterior frontal lobe, appear to be involved inattentional processing.Is there a general theory of attention that embraces the findings from neuralstudies and observed behavior? The answer is yes. This is the theory of biased com-petition,or integrated competition,developed by Desimone and Duncan (1995) andDuncan and colleagues (1997).From the perspective of this theory, attention is seen as a form of competitionamong different inputs that can take place between different representations at allstages of processing.

A very strong bottom-up signal(such as a shattering glass at a party) would be rapidly and efficiently processed,even above the ambient noise of the party. Competition (and selection, which is theresult of the competition) between noise-of-breaking-glass and general-noise-of-party would occur in auditory cortex. The same sort of competition would occurwith inputs in other sensory modalities.The competition between inputs can be biased by the influence of other cogni-tive systems. Focusing on visual processing, Desimone and Duncan (1995) argue thatattention is \u201can emergent property of many neural mechanisms working to resolvecompetition for visual processing and control of behavior\u201d (p. 194). Instead of char-acterizing attention as a spotlight that highlights particular regions of space for pro-cessing, or as a bottleneck or filter, these investigators characterize attention as anintegral part of the perceptual or cognitive process itself. Competition occurs be-cause it is impossible to process everything at once; attention acts as a bias that helpsresolve competition between inputs. So, for example, if the input contains a gray cir-cle, competition would occur between different color representations (or the neuronsthat constitute the representations), and gray would win; the neurons of that repre-sentation would fire, and gray would be considered the winning input. The source ofthe bias can come either from the features in the external stimulus (exogenous) orfrom the relevance of a stimulus to one\u2019s goals of the moment (endogenous).The competition that takes place between possible inputs occurs in multipledifferent brain regions. For example, competition in earlier areas of the visual sys-tem will tend to be influenced by exogenous factors such as color or motion. Thiscompetition will, in turn, affect more anterior brain regions to which these lower-level areas send information for further processing. There, however, endogenousfactors, such as relevance or goals, will tend to bias the competition in regions ofthe brain involved in formulating plans for how to pursue specific goals. Thislater competition can also send information back to the regions of lower-level pro-cessing and modulate the influence of exogenous factors at that level. The theoryholds that many different brain regions are involved in such competition, and be-cause they are connected, the competition is integrated across them. The ultimatewinner of the competition\u2014the item that is ultimately attended\u2014is determined bya consensus among all the different regions working together. Given this perspec-tive, findings that so many different brain areas contribute to attentional selectionare not surprising.One of the original motivations for the idea of competition came from a single-cell recording study in which monkeys were trained to perform a visual search task(Moran & Desimone, 1985). The important result was that when two targets werein the same receptive field, they competed for the cell\u2019s responses. However, whenone of the objects was the target and the other was a distractor, the neuron re-sponded primarily to the target stimulus and blocked processing of the distractorstimulus. If you imagine these competitive processes occurring all along the process-ing stream, one way to understand attention is to think of it as a gating mechanismSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 140REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3579, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "057a903f-5055-4be3-8b54-ee7bdae3d502": {"__data__": {"id_": "057a903f-5055-4be3-8b54-ee7bdae3d502", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "62a51ee3-6739-454e-bade-a346152e1f76", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "9ecf41fd72d7a2e08d0061af1353dd981b959896cd53dec71e4da702ff02c954", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c68f41e9-a3ef-4b6d-bcd0-6c412530ee5b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "6c274c117654eb911b08edb2baf10223610f1eec0e24c0d224e382296e462264", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "09c70607-e17c-4268-84a2-3518e97cda39", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2227f8dda0aca97d9cb8ae88c9a1cc7b8a780d5b833a8606e12010a2f625fd97", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "4. Competition: A Single Explanatory Framework for Attention?141that biases processing according to a combination of external salience and internalgoals. The outcome of the competition is a winner that is selected for further, pref-erential processing.Several ERP and fMRI studies have shown how the ERP waveform or the acti-vation of various brain regions is enhanced or magnified under conditions of com-petition. These increases occur when participants perform more difficultdiscriminations (Lavie, 1995), when distractors compete with targets, and when thedemands of a task are increased. When task demands are increased as in dual-taskconditions, less activation is observed in areas associated with a simultaneous sec-ondary task, reflecting the decrease in processing of nonselected information.Competitive effects are also seen when stimuli appear simultaneously ratherthan sequentially, probably reflecting mutual suppression by simultaneously com-peting stimuli. When four visual stimuli were present, there was less activation invisual cortical area V4 than when only one was present (Kastner et al., 1998). How-ever, when participants were asked to attend to just one of the four stimuli that werepresented simultaneously, activation went up to a level similar to that observed witha single stimulus presented alone (see accompanying, A Closer Lookbox). In theframework of integration competition theory, attending to a single object effectivelyreduced the amount of competition from other stimuli and biased processing towardthat stimulus.Other demonstrations of attentional modulation, obtained with both fMRI andERP techniques, have been found in V1 and other early visual cortical areas(Brefczynski & DeYoe, 1999; Gandhi et al., 1999; Luck & Hillyard, 2000; Noesseltet al., 2002; Somers et al., 1999). some researchers have even found very early at-tentional effects in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, a key informa-tional relay station between the retina and visual cortex in the back of the brain(O\u2019Connor et al., 2002). These results indicate that, as the theory holds, informationcan be sent back to areas that accomplish earlier processing and thereby bias subse-quent processing. Moreover, there is some suggestion that feedback connections toearly visual cortex are involved in determining our conscious experience of visual in-formation (Pascual-Leone & Walsh, 2001).Competition is also evident when a participant is required to divide attentionacross two perceptual features. Compared with a simple condition in which no stim-ulus appears on the screen and the participant stares at a fixation point, attending tothe color or the shape of a stimulus that appears on the screen leads to greater acti-vation of many visual areas. Moreover, if the participant has to switch between at-tending to the color and attending to the shape, additional areas of the brain becomeengaged and\u2014no surprise\u2014regions of parietal cortex are also active (Le et al., 1998;Liu et al., 2003).Many of the findings that demonstrate failures of selection in space or in timecan be explained by the idea of competition between stimuli.

The work, by Sabine Kastner, Peter De Weerd, Robert Desimone, and LeslieUngerleider, was reported in 1998 in \u201cMechanisms of Directed Attention in the Human Extrastriate Cortexas Revealed by Functional MRI,\u201d Science, 282, 108\u2013111.IntroductionThe investigators used fMRI to test ideas about competition and attentional selection. The idea being ex-plored is that the visual system is limited in its capacity to process multiple stimuli at any given time. Thehypothesis: in order for objects to be selected, competition must occur between available objects to yielda \u201cwinner.\u201d The suppression of the eventual winner by the \u201closing\u201d stimuli would give rise to a reduction inthe signal measured by fMRI. In addition, the investigators argue that this suppression can be overcomeeven when multiple objects are present: if attention is directed to one of the objects specifically, the re-sponse would be enhanced and lead to stronger fMRI signals.MethodEight participants viewed images appearing on a screen while lying in the fMRI scanner. Two conditions wereused in the first experiment. In the sequential condition,four complex images were shown in random loca-tions on the screen but only one object was ever present at a single time. In contrast, in the simultaneous con-dition,the same four complex images were present, but in this condition all four were present at the sametime. Because competition (and suppression) can take place when all four are simultaneously present, the ex-pectation was that the fMRI signal from visual cortex in the simultaneous condition would be lower than thesum of the four fMRI signals in the sequential condition. The second experiment was the same as the first butnow, in some sets of trials, participants were instructed to attend to a particular location in which one stimu-lus was presented and to count the occurrences of a particular target stimulus at that location.ResultsMarkedly weaker signals were observed in many visual areas of the brain in the simultaneous than in thesequential condition, supporting the idea that the stimuli presented together competed with one anotherand, in so doing, led to the suppression of some of them. When stimuli are presented one at a time, eachcan activate the brain fully and so the sequential condition leads to stronger fMRI signals. It is interestingand important that in the second experiment, when the participants attended to the location of one of thestimuli, there was an increase in the strength of the fMRI signal, and this signal was even larger than in thesequential condition in some visual areas of the brain.DiscussionThe hypothesis was that competition among multiple stimuli would lead to suppression and that this wouldbe reflected by a reduction in the fMRI signal. This was indeed the case, and this finding provides supportfor the idea that attention is a dynamic process in which stimuli compete for selection. Competition, then,may be the means by which unwanted stimuli are filtered out (they are suppressed and have little or no ac-tivation). The second experiment shows that one can enhance some stimuli by attending to them even ifthere are many stimuli present; this finding shows that along with suppression, enhancement occurs whenone selects a subset of items for further processing.A CLOSERLOOKCompetition and SelectionSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 142REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3538, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ef8d5d2-4f08-4bc6-8b36-accb61c7a6ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ef8d5d2-4f08-4bc6-8b36-accb61c7a6ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6602054f-889c-4af4-b530-403cfffc0eb5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "06fa536412801d6f80fd51f83e2de91e6500beb8d24de39b3676a384cb71d4c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "09c70607-e17c-4268-84a2-3518e97cda39", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "067acdcb71683e4c2133bd15863fc423950d2c77470c2a75a225c600e4c6d3d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "34a2be0f-eaae-44c6-8918-1acb85c0d869", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a06b2dbbde2adc04273ff2fa01df3f595cf3ff87b199fc30d8cb7e69c38e92c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "4. Competition: A Single Explanatory Framework for Attention?143of the valid cue and the location of the target are one and the same, and hence co-operation rather than competition prevails. Also, the effects of divided attentioncan be interpreted as the result of competition between different inputs or differ-ent tasks, as opposed to the noncompetitive case, in which the focus is exclusivelyon a single input or a single task. The improvement, in the form of automaticity,that comes with greater practice with dual tasks may be thought of as a reductionin the competition between the two tasks. Moreover, the performance of patientswith hemispatial neglect can also be understood within this framework of compe-tition. If the damage to the right side of the brain allows the intact hemisphere toproduce a bias away from the left side and toward the right side, that bias in-creases the competitive strength of right-sided stimuli and reduces that of left-sidedstimuli.Failures of selection in time lend themselves to a similar explanation. Thefailure to report T2 in the attentional blink task (see Figure 3\u20134) might arise fromcompetition between T1 and T2. Reporting T2 when it is not preceded by T1 isnot problematic\u2014there is no competition. However, the requirement to report T2when it is preceded by T1 and is very similar to T1 in appearance (say, the lettersare \u201cA\u201d and \u201cH\u201d) establishes a highly competitive environment and reduces thechances of detection of T2. Competition may also explain the failures of selectionin time observed with patients with hemispatial neglect. When visual stimuli arepresented on both sides, reporting of the stimulus on the neglected side improvesdepending on the timing of presentation of the two stimuli and their grouping.One might think of these two factors, time and grouping, as biases that caninfluence the outcome of the competition between stimuli on the right and onthe left.It seems, then, that almost all the behavioral experiments we have discussedcan be interpreted in terms of a competition between \u201cstronger\u201d and \u201cweaker\u201dstimuli, with strength defined by a combination of bottom-up and top-downinfluences. Although not all the details of biased competition have been workedout yet, this framework allows us to explain a wide range of findings; its direc-tion is promising. The advantage of this theory is that it underscores the idea thatattention is a bias in processing, and that processing occurs through cooperativeand competitive interactions among brain areas. Because the different brainareas are connected, they will all contribute to the selection of the target. By com-bining the behavioral results with the inferred involvement of particular brainareas, it is possible to begin to develop an understanding of how attentionaleffects are manifested in the neural system and how those changes affect cognitionand behavior.Comprehension Check:1.How might an attentional blink result from competition between two stimuli?2.Give an example of how a salient bottom-up signal might compete with and winover another stimulus./checkbldSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 143REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3157, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34a2be0f-eaae-44c6-8918-1acb85c0d869": {"__data__": {"id_": "34a2be0f-eaae-44c6-8918-1acb85c0d869", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f2c03053-9352-4e31-a0be-724c2a0fffc9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "01c1badf47326a77b74b95f8a0c2908f513df9c82a6b710fb35941f5d5e244f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ef8d5d2-4f08-4bc6-8b36-accb61c7a6ec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "06fa536412801d6f80fd51f83e2de91e6500beb8d24de39b3676a384cb71d4c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7316a45c-0cd9-41f1-819d-fe2b17bea628", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "47a891875a286187d881fea1a822fbfec8222f298284b77a71a8ba63fb5b4617", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Revisit and Reflect1.What is attention, and how does it operate during cognition?Attention is the process whereby we can select from among the many competingstimuli present in our environment, facilitating processing of some while inhibit-ing processing of others. This selection can be driven endogenously by our goals(e.g., to find a particular friend, to follow an instruction, to use an arrow to directattention), or exogenously by a salient or novel stimulus that captures attentionaway from the task at hand (e.g., bright light, loud noise). Because there is toomuch information at any given moment for us to cope with, attention is the mech-anism by which the most important information is selected for further processing.The type of information that we miss and the conditions under which we miss itare, therefore, the flip side of the cognitive processes involved in attentional selec-tion. Being unaware of the posters on the wall at a party is a failure of selectionthat is a property of selectively searching for features of a friend. Although we arecapable of processing only a limited quantity of information in both space andtime, fortunately selection does not occur randomly. Both our goals and thesalience of information around us determine where and to what we attend.

The debate over whether attention operates atan early or late stage highlighted two aspects of attention.

For example, turning to-ward the sound of crashing glass at a party might result in the incidental selectionof other things in that spatial location such as a piece of furniture, which youwould have otherwise failed to notice. Later theories, such as feature integrationtheory and guided search, proposed more complex models of attention that in-volved early preattentive and later attentive stages of processing. These theoriesprovided a mechanism for how attention integrates information. As theorieschange over time, they build on ideas from previous theories and increase in thedetail of explanation.

They have shown that attentionmodulates processing in early sensory areas such as the primary visual cortexbut that the attentional signal may be generated from processing in the parietaland frontal lobes. The parietal and frontal areas associated with attention areseparated into two neural systems that are interconnected. The more dorsal sys-tem is involved in endogenous attention and tightly connected with the motorsystems that produce eye and other body movements. This system underlies thevoluntary selection of relevant information and the transformation of it into dis-crete actions, such as moving one\u2019s eyes toward a person in green. The more ven-tral system is sensitive to the appearance of new exogenous stimuli, such as thesound of breaking glass, and this system can modulate, and be modulated by sig-nals from the dorsal system. The results suggest that the attentional system inthe brain involves highly interconnected areas that interact to produce effectiveselection of relevant information.SMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 145REVISED PAGES", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3105, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a041b81c-7d64-4745-8f9b-08c489ec27e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a041b81c-7d64-4745-8f9b-08c489ec27e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "84ce549b-7d34-4dd1-8e01-b227a8734184", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "90996f704ddc8821654d5f8c2c6859dab3b8a205c020a6aeec1b265c5b9d450b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7316a45c-0cd9-41f1-819d-fe2b17bea628", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "Attention.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/Attention.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5158820, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "8c0ca7e5729da2b7c38d2427ae0e97e074680f6075b25c409c48676048f8e50d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc2298de-f8d5-4d0f-a27b-ffc4853723a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "47b0381f273ece81c8175edd125b5900257f0c1113655594e490ee8f86c97df6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "146CHAPTER 3 AttentionThink Critically\u25a0Damage to which areas of the brain would impair the endogenous and ex-ogenous attentional systems, respectively?\u25a0What deficits in searching for a friend in a crowded room would you expectto occur if you had brain damage in each of the two attentional systems?\u25a0What properties of the neural systems involved in attention have TMS, ERP,PET, and fMRI helped us to understand?\u25a0What areas of the brain have been found to be involved in attentional pro-cessing, and how are they involved?4.Attention, according to one contemporary theory, is a competition among dif-ferent sources of information, all vying for further processing. Can such a the-ory explain both the behavioral and brain perspectives on attention?The competition framework characterizes attention as a signal that biases pro-cessing toward the most relevant or salient features, which are then processedfurther. Attention as a biasing signal acts within as well as between perceptualand cognitive systems. The outcome of the bias present in one phase of process-ing is passed on to other phases and acts as a bias there. The effects of competi-tion are dynamic, just as experiments have shown attentional effects to be.According to the competition framework, the reason why it is so difficult to findyour friend in a crowded room is because there are too many competing objectsthat are either too similar, such as other people, or too salient, such as crashingglass and loud voices.

YOLO variants are underpinned\nby the principle of real-time and high-classi\ufb01cation performance, based on limited but ef\ufb01cient\ncomputational parameters. This principle has been found within the DNA of all YOLO variants\nwith increasing intensity, as the variants evolve addressing the requirements of automated quality\ninspection within the industrial surface defect detection domain, such as the need for fast detection,\nhigh accuracy, and deployment onto constrained edge devices. This paper is the \ufb01rst to provide an\nin-depth review of the YOLO evolution from the original YOLO to the recent release (YOLO-v8) from\nthe perspective of industrial manufacturing. The review explores the key architectural advancements\nproposed at each iteration, followed by examples of industrial deployment for surface defect detection\nendorsing its compatibility with industrial requirements.\nKeywords: industrial defect detection; object detection; smart manufacturing; quality inspection\n1. Introduction\nHumans via the visual cortex, a primary cortical region of the brain responsible for\nprocessing visual information [ 1], are able to observe, recognize [ 2], and differentiate\nbetween objects instantaneously [ 3]. Studying the inner workings of the visual cortex and\nthe brain in general has paved the way for arti\ufb01cial neural networks (ANNs) [ 4] along\nwith a myriad of computational architectures residing under the deep learning umbrella.\nIn the last decade, owing to rapid and revolutionary advancements in the \ufb01eld of deep\nlearning [5], researchers have exerted their efforts on providing ef\ufb01cient simulation of the\nhuman visual system to computers, i.e., enabling computers to detect objects of interest\nwithin static images and video [ 6], a \ufb01eld known as computer vision (CV) [ 7]. CV is\na prevalent research area for deep learning researchers and practitioners in the present\ndecade. It is composed of sub\ufb01elds consisting of image classi\ufb01cation [ 8], object detection [ 9],\nand object segmentation [ 10]. All three \ufb01elds share a common architectural theme, namely,\nmanipulation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [ 11]. CNNs are accepted as the de\nfacto when dealing with image data. In comparison with conventional image processing\nand arti\ufb01cial defection methods, CNNs utilize multiple convolutional layers coupled with\naggregation, i.e., pooling structures aiming to unearth deep semantic features hidden away\nwithin the pixels of the image [12].\nArti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) has found opportunities in industries across the spectrum\nfrom renewable energy [ 13,14] and security to healthcare [ 15] and the education sector.\nHowever, one industry that is poised for signi\ufb01cant automation through CV is the manu-\nfacturing industry.

These inef\ufb01ciencies provide an opportunity for CV-based\nsolutions to present automated quality inspection that can be integrated within existing\nsurface defect inspection processes, increasing ef\ufb01ciency whilst overcoming bottlenecks\npresented via conventional inspection methodologies [20].\nHowever, for success, CV-based architectures must conform to a stringent set of\ndeployment requirements that can vary from one manufacturing sector to another [ 21]. In\nthe majority of applications, the focus is not only on the determination of the defect, but also\non multiple defects along with the locality details of each [ 22]. Therefore, object detection\nis preferred over image classi\ufb01cation since the latter only focuses on determination of\nobject within the image without providing any locality information. Architectures within\nthe object detection domain can be classi\ufb01ed into single-stage or two-stage detectors [ 23].\nTwo-stage detectors split the detection process into two stages: Feature extraction/proposal\nfollowed by regression and classi\ufb01cation for acquiring the output [ 24]. Although this can\nprovide high accuracy, it comes with a high computational demand making it inef\ufb01cient for\nreal-time deployment onto constrained edge devices. Single-stage detectors, on the other\nhand, merge the two processes into one, enabling the classi\ufb01cation and regression via a\nsingle pass, signi\ufb01cantly reduce the computational demand, and provide a more compelling\ncase for production-based deployment [ 25]. Although many single-stage detectors have\nbeen introduced, such as single shot detector (SSD) [ 26], deconvolutional single shot\ndetector (D-SSD) [ 27], and RetinaNet [ 28], the YOLO (You Only Look Once) [ 29] family of\narchitectures seems to be gaining high traction due to its high compatibility with industrial\nrequirements, such as accuracy, lightweight, and edge-friendly deployment conditions.\nThe last half-a-decade has been dominated by the introduction of YOLO variants, with the\nmost recent variant introduced in 2022 as YOLO-v8.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no cohesive review of the advancing YOLO\nvariants, benchmarking technical advancements, and their implications on industrial\ndeployment. This paper reviews the YOLO variants released to the present date, focusing\non presenting the key technical contributions of each YOLO iteration and its impact on key\nindustrial metrics required for deployment, such as accuracy, speed, and computational\nef\ufb01cacy. As a result, the aim is to provide researchers and practitioners with a better\nunderstanding of the inner workings of each variant, enabling them to select the most\nrelevant architecture based on their industrial requirements. Additionally, literature on\nthe deployment of YOLO architectures for various industrial surface defect detection\napplications is presented.\nThe subsequent structure of the review is as follows. The \ufb01rst section provides an\nintroduction to single- and two-stage detectors and the anatomy for single-stage object\ndetectors. Next, the evolution of YOLO variants is presented, detailing the key contributions\nfrom YOLO-v1 to YOLO-v8, followed by a review of the literature focused on YOLO-based\nimplementation of industrial surface defect detection. Finally, the discussion section\nfocuses on summarizing the reviewed literature, followed by extracted conclusions, future\ndirections, and challenges are presented.\nObject Detection\nCNNs can be categorized as convolution-based feed forward neural networks for\nclassi\ufb01cation purposes [ 30]. The input layer is followed by multiple convolutional layers\nto acquire an increased set of smaller-scale feature maps. These feature maps post further\nmanipulation are transformed into one-dimensional feature vectors before being used as\ninput to the fully connected layer(s). The process of feature extraction and feature map\nmanipulation is vital to the overall accuracy of the network; therefore, this can involve the\nstacking of multiple convolutional and pooling layers for richer feature maps. Popular\narchitectures for feature extraction include AlexNet [ 31], VGGNet [ 32], GoogleNet [ 33], and\nResNet [ 34].

Ther efore, two sets of bounding box vectors are \nrequired, i.e., vector y is the representative of ground truth and vector \ud835\udc66\u1236 is the predicted \nvector. To address multiple bounding boxes containing no object or the same object, \nYOLO opts for non-maximum suppression (NMS). By de \ufb01ning a threshold value for \nNMS, all overlapping predic ted bounding boxes with an IoU lower than the de \ufb01ned NMS \nvalue are eliminated. \nThe original YOLO based on the Darknet framework consisted of two sub-variants. \nThe \ufb01rst architecture comprised of 24 convolutional layers with the \ufb01nal layer providing \na connection into the \ufb01rst of the two fully connected layers. Whereas the \u2018Fast YOLO\u2019 var-\niant consisted of only nine co nvolutional layers hosting fewer \ufb01lters each. Inspired by the \ninception module in GoogleNet, a sequence of 1\u00d71   convolutional layers was imple-\nmented for reducing the resultant feature sp ace from the preceding layers. The prelimi-\nnary architecture for YOLO-v1 is presented in Figure 3. \nTo address the issue of multiple bounding boxes for the same object or with a con \ufb01-\ndence score of zero, i.e., no object, the authors decided to greatly penalize predictions from bounding boxes containing objects ( \ud835\udefe\n\u0bd6\u0be2\u0be2\u0be5\u0bd7 =5) and the lowest penalization for prediction \ncontaining no object ( \ud835\udefe\u0be1\u0be2\u0be2\u0bd5\u0bdd =0 . 5 ). The authors calculated the loss function by taking the \nsum of all bounding  box parameters ( x, y, width , height , con\ufb01dence score, and class prob-\nability). As a result, the \ufb01rst part of the equation computes the loss of the bounding box \nprediction with respect to the ground tr uth bounding box based on the coordinates \n\ud835\udc65\u0bd6\u0bd8\u0be1\u0be7\u0bd8\u0be5 , \ud835\udc66\u0bd6\u0bd8\u0be1\u0be7\u0bd8\u0be5 . \ud835\udd5d\u0bdc\u0bdd\u0be2\u0bd5\u0bdd is set as 1 in the case of the object residing within  \ud835\udc57\u0be7\u0bdb bounding box \nprediction in \ud835\udc56\u0be7\u0bdb cell; otherwise, it is set as 0. The selected, i.e., predicted bounding box \nwould be tasked with predicting an object wi th the greatest IoU, as expressed in (4): \n\ud835\udefe\u0bd6\u0be2\u0be2\u0be5\u0bd7 \u2211\u2211 \ud835\udd5d\u0bdc\u0bdd\u0be2\u0bd5\u0bdd[(\ud835\udc65\u0bdc\u2212\ud835\udc65 \u0c2a\u0ddd)\u0b36+(\ud835\udc66\u0bdc\u2212\ud835\udc66 \u0c2a\u0ddd)\u0b36]\u0bbb\n\u0bdd\u0b40\u0b34\u0bcc\u0c2e\n\u0bdc\u0b40\u0b34   (4)\nThe next component of the loss function computes the prediction error in width and \nheight of the bounding box, similar to the preceding compon ent. However, the scale of \nerror in the large boxes has lesser impact co mpared to the small boxes.

YOLO-v1 preliminary architecture.  \nAs alluded to earlier, the input image is split into s  \u00d7 s grid cells (default = 7  \u00d7 7), with \neach cell predicting B bounding boxes, each containing five parameters and sharing pre-\ndiction probabilities of classes ( C). Therefore,  the parameter output would take the fol-\nlowing form, expressed in (2): \n\ud835\udc60\u00d7\ud835\udc60\u00d7(5\u2217\ud835\udc35+\ud835\udc36)  (2) \nConsidering  the example of YOLO network with each cell bounding box prediction \nset to 2 and evaluating the benchmark COCO dataset consisting of 80 classes, the param-\neter output would be given as  expressed in  (3): \n7\u00d77\u00d7(5\u22172+80)  (3) \nThe fundamental motive of YOLO and object detection in general is the object detec-\ntion and localization via bounding boxes. Therefore , two sets of bounding box vectors are \nrequired , i.e., vector y is the representative of ground truth  and vector \ud835\udc66\u0307 is the predicted \nvector. To address multiple bounding  boxes containing no  object or the same object, \nYOLO opts for non -maximum suppression (NMS). By defining a threshold value for \nNMS, all overlapping predicted bounding boxes with an IoU lower than the defined NM S \nvalue are eliminated.  \nThe original YOLO based on the Dark net framework consisted of two sub -variants. \nThe first architecture comprised of 24 convolutional layers with the final layer providing \na connection  into the first of the two fully connected layers. Whereas the \u2018Fast YOLO \u2019 var-\niant consisted of only nine convolutional layers hosting fewer filters each.

Whilst architectures, such as Fast and Faster\nR-CNN predict coordinates directly from the convolutional network, the original YOLO\nutilized fully connected layers to serve this purpose. YOLO-v2 replaced the fully connected\nlayer responsible for predicting bounding boxes by adding anchor boxes for bounding\nbox predictions. Anchor boxes [ 47] are essentially a list of prede\ufb01ned dimensions (boxes)\naimed at best matching the objects of interest. Rather than manual determination of best-\ufb01t\nanchor boxes, the authors utilized k-means clustering [ 48] on the training set bounding\nboxes, inclusive of the ground truth bounding boxes, grouping similar shapes and plotting\naverage IoU with respect to the closest centroid as shown in Figure 4. YOLO-v2 was trained\non different architectures, namely, VGG-16 and GoogleNet, in addition to the authors\nproposing the Darknet-19 [ 49] architecture due to characteristics, such as reduced process-\ning requirements, i.e., 5.58 FLOPs compared to 30.69 FLOPs and 8.52 FLOPs on VGG-16\nand GoogleNet, respectively.

First, in contrast to its predecesso rs, YOLO-v6 opts for an anchor-free approach, \nmaking it 51% faster when compared to anchor-based approaches. \nSecond, the authors introduced a revised reparametrized backbone and neck, pro-\nposed as E \ufb03cientRep backbone and Rep-PAN neck [66], namely, up to and including \nYOLO-v5, the regression and classi \ufb01cation heads shared the same features. Breaking the \nconvention, YOLO-v6 implements the decoupled head as shown in Figure 9. As a result, \nthe architecture has additional layers separating features from the \ufb01nal head, as empiri-\ncally shown to improve the performance. Thir d, YOLO-v6 mandates a two-loss function. \nVarifocal loss (VFL) [67] is used as the classi \ufb01cation loss and distribution focal loss (DFL) \n[68], along with SIoU/GIoU [69] as regression loss. VFL being a derivative of focal loss, \ntreats positive and negative samples at varying degrees of importance, helping in balanc-\ning the learning signals from both sample types. DFL is deployed for box regression in YOLO-v6 medium and large variants, treating the continuous distribution of the box lo-\ncations as discretized probability distribution, which is shown to be particularly e \ufb03cient \nwhen the ground truth box boundaries are blurred. \n \nFigure 9.

Solar Cell Surface Defect Detection\nSetting their premise, the authors [ 87] state that human-led Photovoltaic (PV) inspec-\ntion has many drawbacks including the requirement of operation and maintenance (O&M)\nengineers, cell-by-cell inspection, high workload, and reduced ef\ufb01ciency. The authors\npropose an improved architecture based on YOLO-v5 for the characterization of complex\nsolar cell surface textures and defective regions. The proposal is based on the integration\nof deformable convolution within the CSP module with the aim of achieving an adaptive\nlearning scale. Additionally, an attention mechanism is incorporated for enhanced feature\nextraction. Moreover, the authors optimize the original YOLO-v5 architecture further via\nK-means++ clustering for anchor box determination algorithm. Based on the presented\nresults, the improved architecture achieved a respectable mAP of 89.64% on an EL-based\nsolar cell image dataset, 7.85% higher compared to mAP for the original architecture, with\ndetection speed reaching 36.24 FPS, which can be translated as a more accurate detection\nwhile remaining compatible with the real-time requirements.\nAmran Binomairah et al. [ 88] highlight two frequent defects encountered during\nthe manufacturing process of crystalline solar cells as dark spot/region and microcracks.\nThe latter can have a detrimental impact on the performance of the module, which is\na major cause for PV module failures. The authors subscribe to the YOLO architecture,\ncomparing the performance of their methodology on YOLO-v4 and an improved YOLO-v4-\ntiny integrated with a spatial pyramid pooling mechanism. Based on the presented results,\nYOLO-v4 achieved 98.8% mAP at 62.9 ms, whilst the improved YOLO-v4-tiny lagged with\n91% mAP at 28.2 ms. The authors claim that although the latter is less accurate, it is notably\nfaster than the former.\nTianyi Sun et al.

The \ufb01rst improvement comes in the form\nof enhanced anchors and detection heads for the respective architecture.

Discussion\nThe YOLO family of object detectors has had a signi\ufb01cant impact on improving the\npotential of computer vision applications. Right from the onset, i.e., the release of the\nYOLO-v1 in 2015, signi\ufb01cant breakthroughs were introduced. YOLO-v1 became the \ufb01rst\narchitecture combining the two conventionally separate tasks of bounding box prediction\nand classi\ufb01cation into one. YOLO-v2 was released in the following year, introducing archi-\ntectural improvements and iterative improvements, such as batch normalization, higher\nresolution, and anchor boxes. In 2018, YOLO-v3 was released, an extension of previous\nvariants with enhancements including the introduction of objectness scores for bounding\nbox predictions added connections for the backbone layers and the ability to generate\npredictions at three different levels of granularity, leading to improved performance on\nsmaller object targets.\nAfter a short delay, YOLO-v4 was released in April 2020, becoming the \ufb01rst variant of\nthe YOLO family not to be authored by the original author Joseph Redmon. Enhancements\nincluded improved feature aggregation, gifting of the \u2018bag of freebies\u2019, and the mish\nactivation. In a matter of months, YOLO-v5 entered the computer vision territory, becoming\nthe \ufb01rst variant to be released without being accompanied by a paper release. YOLO-v5\nbased on PyTorch, with an active GitHub repo further delineated the implementation\nprocess, make it accessible to a wider audience. Focused on internal architectural reforms,\nYOLO-v6 authors redesigned the backbone (Ef\ufb01cientRep) and neck (Rep-PAN) modules,\nwith an inclination toward hardware ef\ufb01ciency. Additionally, anchor-free and the concept\nof decoupled head was introduced, implying additional layers for feature separation from\nthe \ufb01nal head, which is empirically shown to improve the overall performance. The authors\nof YOLO-v7 also focused on architectural reforms, considering the amount of memory\nrequired to keep layers within memory and the distance required for gradients to back-\npropagate, i.e., shorter gradients, resulting in enhanced learning capacity. For the ultimate\nlayer aggregation, the authors implemented E-ELAN, which is an extension of the ELAN\ncomputational block. The advent of 2023 introduced the latest version of the YOLO family,\nYOLO-v8, which was released by Ultralytics. With an impending paper release, initial\ncomparisons of the latest version against predecessors have shown promising performance\nwith respect to throughput when compared to similar computational parameters.\n4.1. Reason for Rising Popularity\nTable 5 presents a summary of the reviewed YOLO variants based on the underlying\nframework, backbone, average-precision (AP), and key contributions. It can be observed\nfrom Table 3 that as the variants evolved there was a shift from the conservative Darknet\nframework to a more accessible one, i.e., PyTorch.

First, the fact that the architectural\ncomposition of YOLO variants is compatible for one-stage detection and classi\ufb01cation\nmakes it computationally lightweight with respect to other detectors. However, we feel\nthat ef\ufb01cient architectural composition by itself did not drive the popularity of the YOLO\nvariants, as other single-stage detectors, such as MobileNets, also serve a similar purpose.\nThe second reason is the accessibility factor, which was introduced as the YOLO\nvariants progressed, with YOLO-v5 being the turning point. Expanding further on this\npoint, the \ufb01rst two variants were based on the Darknet framework. Although this pro-\nvided a degree of \ufb02exibility, accessibility was limited to a smaller user base due to the\nrequired expertise. Ultralytics, introduced YOLO-v5 based on the PyTorch framework,\nmaking the architecture available for a wider audience and increasing the potential domain\nof applications.\nAs evident from Table 6, the migration to a more accessible framework coupled with\narchitectural reforms for improved real-time performance sky-rocketed. At present, YOLO-\nv5 has 34.7 k stars, a signi\ufb01cant lead compared to its predecessors. From implementation,\nYOLO-v5 only required the installation of lightweight python libraries. The architectural\nreforms indicated that the model training time was reduced, which in turn reduced the ex-\nperimentation cost attributed to the training process, i.e., GPU utilization.

YOLO and Industrial Defect Detection\nManifestations of the fourth industrial revolution can be observed at present in an\nad-hoc manner, spanning across various industries. With respect to the manufacturing\nindustry, this revolution can be targeted at the quality inspection processes, which are\nvital for assuring ef\ufb01ciency and retaining client satisfaction. When focusing on surface\ndefect detection, as alluded to earlier, the inspection requirements can be more stringent\nas compared to other applications. This is due to many factors, such as the fact that the\ndefects may be extremely small, requiring external spectral imaging to expose defects prior\nto classi\ufb01cation and due to the fact that the operational setting of the production line may\nonly provide a small-time window within which inference must be carried out.\nConsidering the stringent requirements outlined above and benchmarking against the\nprinciples of YOLO family of variants, forms the conclusion that the YOLO variants have the\npotential to address both real-time, constrained deployment and small-scale defect detec-\ntion requirements of industrial-based surface defect detection. YOLO variants have proven\nreal-time compliance in several industrial environments as shown in [81,84,85,90,95] . An\ninteresting observation arising from the industrial literature reviewed is the ability for users\nto modify the internal modules of YOLO variants in order to take care of their speci\ufb01c ap-\nplication needs without compromising on real-time compliance, for example [81,87,91,92] ,\nintroducing attention-mechanisms for accentuation of defective regions.\nAn additional factor, found within the later YOLO variants is sub-variants for each\nbase architecture, i.e., for YOLO-v5 variants including YOLO-v5-S/M/L, this corresponds\nto different computational loads with respect to the number of parameters. This \ufb02exibility\nenables researchers to consider a more \ufb02exible approach with the architecture selection\ncriteria based on the industrial requirements, i.e., if real-time inference is required with less\nemphasis on optimal mAP , a lightweight variant can be selected, such as YOLO-v5-small\nrather than YOLO-v5-large.\n5. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, this work is the \ufb01rst of its type focused on documenting and reviewing\nthe evolution of the most prevalent single-stage object detector within the computer vision\ndomain. The review presents the key advancements of each variant, followed by imple-\nmentation of YOLO architectures within various industrial settings focused on surface\nautomated real-time surface defect detection.\nFrom the review, it is clear as the YOLO variants have progressed, latter versions in\nparticular, YOLO-v5 has focused on constrained edge deployment, a key requirement for\nmany manufacturing applications. Due to the fact that there is no copyright and patent\nrestrictions, research anchored around the YOLO architecture, i.e., real-time, lightweight,\naccurate detection, can be conducted by any individual or research organization, which has\nalso contributed to the prevalence of this variant.\nWith YOLO-v8 released in January 2023, showing promising performance with respect\nto throughput and computational load requirements, it is envisioned that 2023 will see\nmore variants released by previous or new authors focused on improving the deployment\ncapacity of the architectures with respect to constrained deployment environments.\nWith research organizations, such as Ultralytics and Meituan Technical Team taking\na keen interest in the development of YOLO architectures with a focus on edge-friendly", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3739, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21c2d440-2dfe-48df-be2c-59569ac73bc6": {"__data__": {"id_": "21c2d440-2dfe-48df-be2c-59569ac73bc6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "YOLO-v1_to_YOLO-v8_the_Rise_of_YOLO_and_Its_Comple.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/YOLO-v1_to_YOLO-v8_the_Rise_of_YOLO_and_Its_Comple.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6049935, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3c4fa1e9-bc9d-4adf-a615-ae6cf2f9ccd3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "YOLO-v1_to_YOLO-v8_the_Rise_of_YOLO_and_Its_Comple.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/YOLO-v1_to_YOLO-v8_the_Rise_of_YOLO_and_Its_Comple.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6049935, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "fb4861e95e3884648a81d12a545b93786fc519256667974fa7c30f93c9ba0d04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "596e1c9d-2abe-4dce-9f9d-dbcb4758430d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "YOLO-v1_to_YOLO-v8_the_Rise_of_YOLO_and_Its_Comple.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/marwahfaraj/Desktop/LIAMAIndex/data/YOLO-v1_to_YOLO-v8_the_Rise_of_YOLO_and_Its_Comple.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6049935, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "8ec8c5df330885cabe23022b349a9b437993fe04644d42c2ef656aced833380a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "880a11f9-fd24-4349-a765-a586eb0fb13f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2bc2736e23ae73d3430eb359e4bc2a19e5814cce6938bb83d0887c3b0a005c85", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Machines 2023 ,11, 677 22 of 25\ndeployment, we anticipate further technological advancements in the architectural footprint\nof YOLO.
